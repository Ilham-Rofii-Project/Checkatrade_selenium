Garden lighting costs can be affected by a range of factors, such as the number of light fitting you want to be installed, their location and the price of the fixings.
The costs within this guide are average costs to install exterior lights. Your total outdoor garden light installation costs may be higher or lower.
Our prices in this guide were provided by the online estimators at  My Build Estimate  – a professional estimating company monitored by the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors  (RICS). What are the different types of exterior lighting? The type of external lighting you choose should be dictated by the area you want to light, and the purpose of your lighting.
External lighting options include:
Wall lights
 – fixed to a wall, they can improve the atmosphere of an outdoor garden.
Post lights
 – attached to the floor, post lights are illuminated bollards used for wayfinding.
Decking lights (often called soffit lights)
 – fitted into your decking, these lights are great for wayfinding, garden parties and events.
Security lights
 – motion-activated security lights will illuminate an area if they detect movement.

What is Extra Low Voltage power?
Most garden light systems use Extra Low Voltage (ELV) power. In the majority of systems, power is taken from the nearest existing power source in the house, usually the kitchen. However, you can have an exterior 230v 3-pin socket fitted if you choose to.
The costs in this guide do not include linking lights to the consumer unit, which can be more expensive depending on the location of the unit.
ELV power is preferred because it’s safe and secure and doesn’t need to be reported to building control. The garden lights installation costs in this guide refer to ELVs. What is involved in installing garden lights? These are some of the steps you will follow in planning and installing your garden lights:
Identifying light locations
Before deciding, consider the best place(s) to locate your lights in the garden. Think about how you use the space and how lights can improve your enjoyment of it.
Placing and connecting cabling to supply power to the lights
Garden lights will require power, usually delivered through power cables. Plan out the route of cabling around any obstacles.
Electrical work
You’ll need to hook up the lights to the mains. The cost to install a new light fixture may also include fitting a 230v 3-pin external socket.
Fitting and testing
Lights will be fitted, connected and tested to ensure they work properly.
Patio lighting installed by  Newco Electrical Factors affecting the cost to install exterior lights The cost to install lighting in your garden will depend upon certain factors, such as:
Type of fixtures
 – the more expensive the fixture, the higher the cost.
Number of lighting elements
 – the more fixtures that you have, the higher the garden light installation costs.
Distance from the property 
– external lights need cabling for power and so the further from the property, the longer – and more expensive – the cabling required.
Making good
 – You may need to allow an additional sum for making good for any chases or holes in walls and ceilings, or for trunking and containment if the light is surface-mounted
Fixings
 – the location of the lights can affect the total cost to install a new light fixture.
Brightness
 – brighter and more powerful lights are more expensive than low-output models, which can increase purchase and installation costs.
Location
 – garden light installation costs can vary across the UK, with those in cities such as London paying more than those in other areas, for example.
Soffit lighting installation
 – soffit lighting installation costs will differ, depending on the location, materials used and access.

Patio lighting installed by  Newco Electrical Outdoor lighting installation costs The average cost to install a single low voltage wall light is £165.
This price covers the labour to install the light and to safely connect the light to the mains power supply.
LED lights arranged throughout the garden are a popular and attractive alternative to fixed wall lights. The average cost to install 10 LED light clusters plugged into an existing socket and provide 65 metres of cable is 
£400
.

Find an electrician near you  Soffit lighting installation costs Soffit lights are garden lights that are fitted to the underside of decking, roofs or porches. They’re usually arranged in patterns and together provide a pleasant and atmospheric light.
The average cost to install a series of soffit lights is £400.
 This includes cabling, installation and testing. Outdoor security lighting installation costs The average cost to install an outdoor security light is £150.
 More powerful 30-watt versions may cost 
£175
 to install.
Outdoor security lighting installation costs can vary according to the cost of the fitting and the distance from your property. Be prepared to pay more for brighter lights and those with additional features, such as ‘intelligent’ motion detection that won’t be switched on by animals, for example. Outdoor lighting installation cost calculator The main factors that will help you calculate the cost of installing outdoor lighting are the quantity of lights to be installed, their exact location, any additional wiring needed, and the complexity of the installation itself. You’ll also need to factor in the cost of the materials.
For accurate prices, speak to your local experienced electricians and ask for a breakdown of the costs of installing outdoor lights in your area. Outdoor lighting installation quotes We always recommend obtaining at least three quotes from our trusted tradespeople. Our  request a quote  feature is perfect for getting quotes – you post details about the job you want doing and we’ll send it out to local tradespeople in your area.  Try it out! Outdoor lighting installation hourly rates On average, an electrician will charge around 
£45 per hour
 to install exterior lights. The exact rate you pay will depend on the individual electrician, their experience and where you live in the country. To find out more, check out our guide to  electrician hourly rates .

Find an electrician near you  Additional outdoor lighting costs Here are some additional garden light installation costs that you should budget for.
The prices are based on the fitting of a light switch, or local sensor. More advanced lighting systems with digital controls can be more expensive.
If you are drilling through walls, budget for the cost to make good any damaged plaster or paintwork.
If your light is surface mounts, garden light installation costs may be higher as you may need to pay for trunking and containment.
If you need to run armoured cables (to wall mounted lights on walls on other properties), then expect to pay more.
If you need to fit an external 230v socket, expect to pay 
£125
. Should I install my exterior lights myself? Fitting external wall lights is a job for a qualified, professional electrician. External lights may be low-voltage, but any time you are working with live current, you must be careful.

Roof tile replacement cost,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/roof-tile-replacement-cost/,Tag Not Found,"Roof tile replacement cost

In This Blog: What is the cost of replacing roof tiles? Reasons roof tiles might need replacing Cost of replacing roof tiles Factors affecting the cost of roof tile replacement Roof tile replacement cost calculator Roof tile replacement quote Roof tile replacement hourly rates How long does it take to replace roof tiles? Can I replace my roof tiles myself? Roof tile replacement cost overview While roof tiles are designed to withstand the weather, constant exposure to the elements eventually takes its toll. No matter how resilient, all roof tile materials are susceptible to cracks and deterioration over time.
If left unchecked, rainwater can leak through the cracks and cause structural damage to your home. In short,  if your tiles have been damaged either during or after installation, it’s best to get them replaced without delay.
While the cost of individual tiles may be cheap, the job of replacing them requires skill and specialist equipment such as scaffolding. To give you an idea of pricing ahead of hiring a tradesperson, we’ve put together a practical guide outlining the average roof tile replacement cost.
Level of access
Number of tiles
Average cost
Tiles easily sourced and no access issues or scaffold 
Up to 5 tiles
£170
Roof ladder and cement bedding required
Up to 5 tiles
£225
Difficult access requiring scaffold plus hard to find tiles
Up to 5 tiles
£500
Complete tiled roof replacement
Full roof replacement
£10,000
Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now What is the cost of replacing roof tiles? The average roof tile replacement cost is 
£170
 for up to five broken tiles, presuming the replacement tiles can be easily sourced and there are no access issues.
Depending on the condition of your roof and your budget, you may choose to have the entire roof replaced or simply have a tradesperson replace the damaged tiles. As well as the cost of materials, the quote provided will reflect the amount of work needed and how easy your roof can be accessed.
When hiring a roofer, it might make sense for them to carry out a full inspection in case there are other areas that need attention. For example, if roof tiles at the bottom of your roof have been damaged, the fascia board that sits underneath them will get damp as a result and begin to decay. This is especially concerning for older properties that have wooden soffits and fascias.

Find a roofer near you  Reasons roof tiles might need replacing They may be long-lasting by design, but roof tiles are fragile and can get damaged or broken in a number of ways. Exposure to adverse weather such as heavy winds and harsh frost, long-term usage and moisture eventually causes the asphalt to weaken and the protective coating to wear away. Often, high winds can dislodge tiles completely from the wooden batten they sit on.
The cost to repair a slipped roof tile professionally tends to sit at
 £170
, though costs can increase to
 £225
 when cement bedding and roof ladders are needed and up to 
£500
 if  scaffolding  is required.
Upon inspection, you or the contractor may notice tiles with hairline cracks. The most common causes for these are protruding nails from under the tiles or weather damage during severe storms.
Cracks can easily be overlooked, but the more they widen, the more vulnerable the interior of your roof to water damage. When the crack runs across the length of the tile, it’s advisable to get them replaced rather than repaired. Cost of replacing roof tiles The cost of replacing roof tiles will depend on the level of work required.
For a complete replacement of a tiled roof, you can expect an average total cost of 
£10,000
. Individual roof tile replacement will naturally be a lot cheaper, with prices starting at around 
£170
 for up to five tiles. Quotes will be calculated upon inspection as there may be access issues that drive up the total cost.

Find a roofer near you  Factors affecting the cost of roof tile replacement When hiring a roofing contractor to repair or replace roof tiles, the total roof tile replacement cost they quote for the job will be determined by several key factors, including:
Ease of access to the roof
Depending on the size of your property and the accessibility of your roof, it may be necessary for health and safety precautions for professionals to use cement bedding and roof ladders to complete the job. For five tiles replaced using a roof ladder, the cost is approximately 
£225
 to cover labour and equipment. In some cases, it may be necessary to erect scaffolding, which will increase the time taken and increase the final price to roughly
 £500
.
Location
As with most home renovation or repair work, you can expect roof tile replacement costs to be higher in London than the regional average.
Number of damaged tiles
Simply put, the more tiles that need replacing, the higher the total cost. If the budget allows and your roof is in particularly poor condition, it might be worthwhile to have the roof replaced entirely to give you peace of mind in the future.
General condition of the roof
When roof tiles lose their protecting coating and become weakened from long-term exposure to weather, it’s common for them to crack, break or even come loose. If your roof has more than a handful of slipped, cracked or damaged tiles, the job of replacing them without causing further damage will be more challenging and therefore cost more.
Type of tile replacement
Number of tiles
Average cost
Ridge tile replacement
Up to 6 ridge tiles
£180
Re-bed ridge tiles
Up to 10 metres of ridge tiles
£500
Roof valley tile replacement
Up to 4 metres of roof valley tiles
£500
Type of tiles
Cost of replacing ridge tiles
When ridge tiles come loose from the roof, getting them re-cemented is essential in stopping further damage from weather exposure. The process of re-bedding ridge tiles involves taking them off, cleaning and re-fixing them firmly in place.
Depending on the condition they’re in, you may need to have the ridge tiles replaced altogether. The average cost for six ridge tiles is 
£182.50
, based on a range of roughly
 £140 – £225
.
Cost of replacing roof valley tiles
A roof valley is where two sloping roofs meet together, where rainwater flows from the roof to the gutter. Typically made from lead, concrete tiles or fibreglass, the placement and function of roof valleys make them more susceptible to damage than the rest of the roof.
Depending on the condition of your roof valleys, the job could involve a small repair or a full replacement. The average cost of replacing roof valley tiles is 
£500
, based on four metres of roof valley including fibreglass trough and underlay.

Find a roofer near you  Roof tile replacement cost calculator The best way to calculate the cost of roof tile replacement for your home is to work out how many tiles need to be replaced and what size and material they are. Once you know the material costs you’ll need to add the cost of the labour for a roofer to carry out the work. The more tiles and the more complex the roof structure, the higher the tile replacement cost will be. Roof tile replacement quote We always recommend obtaining at least three quotes from our trusted tradespeople. Our  request a quote  feature is perfect for getting quotes – you post details about the job you want doing and we’ll send it out to local tradespeople in your area.  Try it out! Want to know how to hire the best roofer for the job? Check out our guide to  hiring a roofer . Roof tile replacement hourly rates The average cost for a roofer is around 
£18 to £25 per hour
. The exact price you pay will depend on the individual roofer, their experience, and where you live in the country. For more information about prices check out our  roof installation cost guide .

Find a roofer near you  How long does it take to replace roof tiles? The timescale for roof tile replacement will inevitably depend on how many tiles need replacing.
It should only take two hours for a professional roofing contractor to replace up to five tiles, assuming your roof is easy enough to access. If the job requires a roof ladder and some cement bedding, it will take an average of three hours, while a job that requires scaffolding will be more like five hours.
For an entire roof to be replaced on a three-bed house with medium or large concrete roof tiles, you can expect at least three to four days for the roof replacement itself, though additional work such as replacement of roof rafters, guttering, soffits and fascia boards will increase the time taken to a week or up to two weeks if access requires scaffolding. Can I replace my roof tiles myself? Due to the hazardous nature of this work, we strongly recommend hiring a qualified and experienced tradesperson to repair or replace roof tiles. Professional roofing contractors undergo training to perform roof tile replacements safely.
The cost of replacing roof tiles professionally varies, but it’s a worthwhile investment in protecting your roof from further damage and risking injury through a DIY approach.

Find a roofer near you  Roof tile replacement cost overview No matter how resilient, roof tiles get damaged over time. Getting them replaced can prevent structural damage to your property.
The costs for replacing individual roof tiles ranges between 
£170
 – 
£500
 for five roof tiles; the main factor driving this cost is access to the roof and need for equipment.
Re-bedding 10 metres of ridge tiles costs an average of 
£500
.
To re-bed four metres of roof valley tiles including fibreglass trough and felt underlay, the average price is 
£500
.
Roof tile replacement is a dangerous job with a high risk of accident and injury, so we strongly recommend calling on the services of a professional roofer who is trained and insured to handle the job.

In This Blog: Types of carpentry Factors affecting the cost of carpentry prices Carpenter prices going rate Second fix carpentry cost price Should I hire a professional carpenter? Key insights So, you’re looking for carpentry prices and want to know what to expect? Well, before we begin, let’s take a look at what kind of jobs a carpenter completes.
Carpentry is a woodworking skill that requires a carpenter to make or repair things using various types of wood. The reasons someone might need to hire a carpenter range from timber roofs and fitted wardrobes to handmade bookshelves and made-to-measure staircases.
In this carpentry prices guide, we’re going to discuss the different types of carpentry that exist and the factors affecting carpenter prices. We spoke to the online estimators at  My Build Estimate  – a professional estimating company monitored by the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors  (RICS) and we’ve used their estimated, average costs to work out the prices in this guide. Types of carpentry There are various types of carpentry that require different carpenter skill sets. Most carpenters will choose a specialism and become an expert in that field. Examples include:
Rough carpenter
Those who specialise in framing, formwork, roofing and structural works, including stairs, decking and shelving.
Joister
Those who lay floor joists in preparation for floor surfaces.
Trim or finish carpenter
Those who specialise in mouldings and trims, e.g., mantles, skirting boards, baseboards and door frames.

Those who specialise in the skeletal wooden framework of buildings.
Roofer
Those who specialise in the rafters, beams and trusses of roof constructions.
Cabinet maker
Those who specialise in intricate and detailed work for furniture, e.g., wardrobes, dressers and storage chests.

Find a garage door expert near you  Types of garage door and replacement costs Sectional garage doors
These are one of the most popular styles of garage doors for British homeowners. The door itself is made up of a collection of panelled sections joined together with hinges.
As the door opens and closes, the sections are able to fold a certain point on the track that they’re on. This design allows the door to be held parallel to the garage ceiling when it’s completely open, taking up minimal space in the garage.
Roller garage doors
Roller garages originally became popular in commercial garage units, but they’re becoming increasingly used in domestic garages as more appealing designs become available.
They’re generally made of steel slats that roll around a central drum that is held above the garage door opening. They are built to withstand heavy usage (hence their commercial popularity), which also means they tend to cost more than sectional garage doors.
Electric garage doors
Electric garage doors come in a variety of models, but all of them are designed to be used with an electric operating system. This makes it the easiest option for opening and closing as it involves little effort on your part.
The most common operating devices are a wall-mounted button on the inside of the garage, and a handheld device to use from the outside. Nowadays there are also a range of hi-tech accessories including keyfobs, wireless keypads, app-enabled garage door opening systems, and even fingerprint scanners.
Side-hinged garage doors
Side-hinged garage doors resemble barn doors in their design, as they rely on a very classic hinged frame for opening and closing. They’re usually made of wood, but they are available in other materials.
This style of garage door has become popular with homeowners who have limited space or obstructions in the roof of their garage (which get in the way of other garage door mechanisms). Side-hinged garage doors are also a popular choice for open carports that don’t have a full building structure around them.
Up and over garage doors
The ‘up and over’ canopy-style garage doors are made of one solid piece of material, rather than sections joined together. They use a pivoting hinge mechanism, which means they tilt up into the garage when opened.
This style of garage door is found on many older garages as it was the default design for many years in the UK, and it is also generally the cheapest option available.

Find a garage door expert near you  Things to consider when replacing your garage door When looking at the cost of garage door replacement, it’s worth asking yourself a number of questions before making your decision:
Which opening mechanism do you need?
What colour garage door would match your home?
What material do you want, or can you afford?
Do you need insulation for your garage door?
Answering these questions will help you have a better idea of what you need, so you can find out more accurate prices for your exact garage door replacement. How long does it take to fit a garage door? Usually between two hours and one day
. The time it takes will depend on the type of garage door that you currently have and the type you’re replacing it with. Garage doors with mechanical systems will take longer to install. Can I replace a garage door myself? We would highly recommend hiring a local garage door expert to install your replacement door. Due to the size of garage doors and the complexity of their mechanisms, it can be a tough job to remove your existing door and replace it with the new one yourself. Useful garage door replacement checklist Speak to local garage door experts for professional advice and accurate prices.
If in doubt, ask local garage door suppliers for in-person demonstrations to help you choose the right garage door type for you.
When hiring a professional tradesperson, make sure they have the relevant experience and qualifications/accreditations.
Always shop around for fair and competitive prices.

Portable rug cleaning machines are available to hire, but in this guide, we’re focusing on the costs of using a professional rug cleaning service.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now How much does professional rug cleaning cost? As with many professional services, the costs can vary depending on a number of factors. The most common influences that will affect the price of professional rug cleaning include:
Size and age of the rug
Fabric it’s made from
Condition
Location
Average professional rug cleaning cost: £19 – £27 (small rug) or £33 – £56 (large rug) Types of professional rug cleaning There are a number of professional rug cleaning options available, depending on the type of rug and degree of dirt and stains. The most common are:
Steam cleaning
 — used for rugs made of durable fabrics and for thorough disinfection.
Dry cleaning
 — popular for silk rugs and other fabrics that require lighter treatment.
Foam cleaning
 — no liquids are used, making it suitable for rugs that would otherwise be at risk of shrinking and tearing (e.g. suede, linen and 100% wool).
Cold water extraction cleaning
 — many green cleaning advocates encourage the use of cold water as it won’t release fumes and generally uses considerably less energy.
Deep cleaning
 — suitable for old and very soiled rugs.
Delicate rugs, such as wool rugs, silk rugs, Oriental rugs and Persian rugs, require individual attention, which will affect the cleaning cost. Therefore, it’s important to speak to a local rug cleaning expert for professional advice and accurate prices.
Professional oriental rug cleaning cost: £30 per m2
Average Persian rug cleaning cost: £30 per m2
Average wool rug cleaning cost: £15 per m2

Find a rug cleaner near you  Benefits of professional rug cleaning Although there are DIY options for cleaning your beloved rug yourself, there are a number of benefits that come with using a professional rug cleaning service:
Professionals use specialist tools and high-quality products that cater for all rug types.
They’re skilled at removing stains from delicate fabrics without damaging them.
Rug cleaning experts know how to remove stains and odours whilst preserving the dyes and colours.
Hiring a professional rug cleaner reduces the risks of shrinkage, fraying or other permanent damage.
Taking professional care of your rug will extend its life. Do I need to hire a professional rug cleaner? This will depend on the type of rug you have and the condition it’s in. If you have a heavily soiled or delicate rug (Persian, antique, silk, etc) then we would highly recommend you hire a professional rug cleaner.
Some modern rugs made of more durable or synthetic fabrics can be cleaned to a decent standard using DIY methods (off-the-shelf products or hiring a portable rug cleaning machine), but it’s still worth speaking to a professional for advice first. Useful rug cleaning checklist Start by speaking to a local rug cleaning expert to get advice about the best options for your rug.
Be curious about the cleaning methods they use to understand which one suits your rug.
Ask about eco-friendly cleaning services that don’t use strong chemicals.
Take photos of your rug in good lighting so that professional rug cleaning can provide you with a more accurate quote.
Always shop around for fair and competitive rug cleaning prices.

When you eventually do decide to get your couch cleaned, you will notice the immediate difference it can make in freshening up your lounge or living space. But what are the average sofa cleaning prices?
Whether you are moving out of rented accommodation, have special visitors coming to stay or simply want to bring your sofa back to life – professional help is usually the best and most reliable way to go. With this in mind, we have put together the following cost guide explaining the typical sofa cleaning service price.

The table to the right shows the average sofa cleaning prices by item. Types of upholstery cleaning Depending on the condition of your sofa, a professional will use one of the following methods for couch cleaning:
Steam cleaning
Steam cleaning is a versatile way of lifting stains and rejuvenating well-used furniture back to its former glory. This method involves vacuuming and spraying professional furniture cleaning solution before applying high-temperature steam to loosen and dissolve dirt, brightening the fabric’s colours.
Dry upholstery cleaning
Dry upholstery involves a pre-treatment stage where existing stains are treated with a cleaning solution. After the pre-treatment, an upholstery professional applies a dry solvent to the pre-treated areas, before using an automatic machine with rotating brushes to remove stain, dirt and debris. Factors affecting sofa cleaning costs Upholstery cleaning prices are mostly based on a per-item model. If you only have one item that needs to be cleaned, you can keep your costs down considerably. The size of your sofa will play a role in the total sofa cleaning cost, with 2-seater sofas understandably cheaper to clean than 4-seaters or L-shape sofas.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now How much does oven cleaning cost? A standard oven cleaning for a single oven in the UK will cost around 
£50
. However, there are a number of factors that can affect the prices of a professional oven cleaning service:
Size and style of the oven
Condition of dirt
The extent of the clean (it will cost more to have the hob and extractor cleaned too)
Location (oven cleaning is cheaper in some parts of the country than in others).

£57 Regional oven cleaning cost One of the factors that will affect the average cost of an oven clean is the geographical location. Costs tend to be higher in Greater London and the East of England than in Scotland and in the North West. It’s always worth getting multiple quotes to get the best price from a professional tradesperson near you.
Note:
 The average prices shown here are indicative prices of oven cleaning calculated from customer feedback sent to Checkatrade. These jobs may vary in complexity but this gives you an idea of what expert tradespeople in your local area are charging. What’s involved in professional oven cleaning? Professional oven cleaners will come equipped with the latest tools and products to provide high-level oven cleaning. In most cases that means they will:
Clean the interior cavity, door, glass and racks of your oven.
Take out the removable parts of the oven and soak them in a specialised cleaning solution.
Use biodegradable, fume-free, non-caustic and other eco-friendly products.
Clean all oven makes and models within three hours.

Find a professional oven cleaner near you  Types of oven Single oven
Average single oven cleaning cost: £50
Time: 1-2 hours
Single ovens are what the majority of British homeowners have in their kitchen. They’re about 60cm tall and are often slotted under countertops or at eye level.
Cleaning a single oven is the most straightforward and comes with the lowest price tag.
Double oven
Average double oven cleaning cost: £70
Time: 1-2 hours
Designed for family cooking and entertaining, a double oven offers more versatility for cooking. Double ovens are commonly installed at eye level and measure about 90cm high.
In general, double cookers are fairly straightforward to clean but they can take slightly longer and cost more because of their size.
Range cooker
Average range cooker cleaning cost: £90
Time: 2-3 hours
A range cooker combines an oven and hob in one and is typically bigger than a standard oven. Many range cookers feature two ovens, as well as a separate grill, warming drawers, and sometimes even storage compartments.
Due to their larger size and more complex structure, cleaning range cookers takes longer and costs more than standard ovens.
Hob
Average hob cleaning cost: £15 – £20
Time: 30-60 mins
There are commonly five types of hob in UK homes, these are ceramic, gas, electric, induction and domino. The cleaning process will vary slightly between the different hob types but should generally be done in under an hour, whichever hob you have.

Find a professional oven cleaner near you  How long does professional oven cleaning take? Cleaning a standard oven, hob and hood takes about 1-3 hours. For larger ovens and range cookers cleaning may take longer (and cost more). What are the benefits of professional oven cleaning? It might seem obvious that having your oven cleaned professionally means it gives you a fresh and clean oven to use. There are also a number of other benefits that more than justify the price you pay for professional oven cleaning:
Professionals have the right equipment to take your oven apart and give it a thorough cleaning, quickly and easily.
Clean ovens are safer as burnt-on food and grease increase the risk of an oven fire.
Better energy efficiency because burnt-on residue requires more energy to heat up the oven, and a clean oven door means you don’t need to open it to check your food.
Save time by letting a professional clean your oven much quicker and more thoroughly than doing it yourself.
Food tastes better cooked in a clean oven because it’s not taking on the flavours of old food residue.
Saves money thanks to the improved efficiency lowering your energy bills.
Avoid the hassle and mess of the cleaning process and the clean-up afterwards. Can I clean my oven myself? You certainly can, however, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to reach the same level of cleanliness that a professional oven cleaning service can offer for the cost. Plus, it will take you a lot longer as you most likely won’t have the right tools or cleaning agents to do a thorough job easily. Additional costs to consider As well as the cost of cleaning the main oven unit itself, there are additional costs to consider. Depending on your oven type you’ll probably want the professional cleaning service to also clean the hob and extractor fan/hood, so include that in your budget.
Average additional oven cleaning price list
Ceramic/glass hob cleaning cost: £17.50
Gas/electric hob cleaning cost: £15
Oven hood/extractor cleaning cost: £15 Useful oven cleaning checklist Speak to your local oven cleaning experts for advice and accurate prices.
Ask if they offer eco-friendly or chemical-free oven cleaning services.
Request a detailed quote so you know what the oven cleaning prices include (racks, hob, hood, etc)
When hiring a professional tradesperson make sure they are licensed and insured

01616 761522  What are the benefits of fitted wardrobes? Fitted wardrobes are one of the best space-saving solutions for your home that come with a whole host of benefits:
Maximise space, particularly in awkward spaces where traditional shop-bought wardrobes wouldn’t fit or would waste space.
Fully customisable designs mean your fitted wardrobe will be perfectly tailored to the space and your storage needs.
Keep your home tidy and organised with bespoke units, such as shoe racks, extra shelves and longer rails.
No more awkward cleaning because fitted wardrobes don’t have nuisance gaps or awkward ledges where dust collects.
Add value to your home whilst simultaneously improving the usability of your property.
Stylish and streamlined finishes in a wide range of designs make fitted wardrobes suitable for every home. Different types of fitted wardrobes and average prices One of the greatest features of fitted wardrobes is that they can be fully customised both inside and out. Built-in wardrobes will cater for your personal style and fit in any space, no matter how big, small or awkward it might seem.
Below are the most popular types of fitted wardrobe for British homeowners.
Standard fitted wardrobes
Average 3-door fitted wardrobe cost: £2,650
A standard fitted wardrobe comes with hinged doors that open outwards, like a standard wardrobe. They will be divided into different sections, depending on the space they’re filling and the internal units you choose.
The doors themselves are available in a range of materials, including MDF, wood, glass and metal. And there is a wide variety of door styles, such as plain, grooved, panelled, mirrored, handle-less, and with windows.
Sliding door fitted wardrobes
Average 3-section sliding fitted wardrobe cost: £3,200
If space is sparse in your home, you might want to go for fitted wardrobes with sliding doors. Instead of hinges, these wardrobes make use of doors that move by sliding on a runner.
As with standard fitted wardrobes, there are a lot of options for the style of doors and the features of the internal storage. Mirrored glass doors tend to be very popular as they help make smaller spaces look larger, and provide a full-length mirror at the same time.

Find wardrobe experts your neighbours recommend 
Extra-wide fitted wardrobes
Average 6-door wide fitted wardrobe cost: £4,800
If you have a very large bedroom or the luxury of a walk-in wardrobe, then you’ll need an extra-wide fitted wardrobe. Put simply, it’s a wider version of a standard or sliding door fitted wardrobe.
Being much larger, the prices of extra-wide fitted wardrobes are higher but then you’re literally getting much more for your money.
Custom-built fitted wardrobes
Average 2-section custom built fitted wardrobe cost: £3,200
By definition, fitted wardrobes are adapted to create a bespoke wardrobe for your home. However, if you’re looking for something very specific you also have the option to have custom-built wardrobes made.
Like other fitted wardrobes, they allow you to fit around sloped ceilings, wonky walls and recesses, but the materials and/or internal units will be designed and built to meet your exact needs. Fitted wardrobe cost calculator Using the figures above you can calculate the average cost of the fitted wardrobe you require in your home. Of course, the actual cost of your wardrobe will depend on your individual specification and will be influenced by the size, quality, materials used and additional fittings you choose.
For example, if you had two walls to choose from and one was longer than the other, then the cost would be greater to fit a wardrobe on the longer one. Also, as with all furniture and fittings, there are various quality levels you can choose from and materials that can be used.
As you’d expect, oak built-in wardrobes cost considerably more than MDF alternatives, and if you want to add soft close doors, shoe racks and lighting, then this would make your fitted wardrobe project more expensive than if you simply request a basic shell, shelves and doors.
Ultimately, answering the question: how much are fitted wardrobes? can be done using the figures above, just be aware that you’ll pay more if you want a more bespoke finish.

Find wardrobe experts your neighbours recommend 
Fitted wardrobes internal storage
One of the factors that will affect the total built-in wardrobe cost is your choice of internal storage units. Generally, you can ‘mix and match’ different types of storage so that they’re configured exactly how you want them.
As well as standard rails, drawers and shelves, you can also have more specialised features, including:
Pull-out shoe racks
Double-hanging clothes rails
Pull-down rails (for higher, hard-to-reach sections)
Jewellery tray
Cosmetics unit
Laundry baskets
Pigeon holes
Trouser rails
Integrated lighting How long does it take to install fitted wardrobes? Usually between one and two days, however, the time needed for installing your fitted wardrobes will depend on the size and complexity of the space and wardrobe units themselves. Can I fit my built-in wardrobes myself? If you’re a strong and confident DIY enthusiast, you might want to fit the wardrobes yourself. However, fitting a built-in wardrobe can be tricky and is at least a two-man job if you’re attempting yourself. We would highly recommend hiring a professional tradesperson to give you peace of mind that the work has been done safely and to a high standard. Built-in wardrobe installation quote At the point of actually getting a quote for your fitted wardrobes, you can get a more accurate figure, and minimise future headaches once installation begins, by specifying exactly what you need done and providing drawings and measurements if you can. When sourcing quotes, it’s also essential to find and reach out to multiple recommended tradespeople to get a comprehensive cross-section of prices and approaches to your job. Then you can make the decision to go ahead feeling completely comfortable with both the price of the project, and the professionalism of your chosen built-in wardrobe specialist. Useful fitted wardrobe checklist Plan ahead by taking time to consider what clothing and other items you use regularly and make sure the internal design of your wardrobe accommodates them.
Make the most of shelving by using baskets or shelf dividers to partition the space.
Speak to local fitted wardrobe experts for advice and accurate prices for your space.
Ask for a full list of the options for internal and external designs, there are a lot of cool storage solutions out there.
Choose a style and materials for your fitted wardrobes that will match the space they’re filling.
Always shop around for fair and competitive prices.
When planning your budget for your fitted wardrobes make sure you include the cost of the materials and labour, as carpenter and installation labour costs can quickly add up.
When hiring a professional tradesperson, always choose someone with proven experience and relevant accreditations.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now How much does it cost to install a door? The cost to install new doors will vary on a number of factors such as the type of door, any complexities around the installation, and where you are located in the UK.
At the cheaper end of the scale, there are 
softwood internal doors
. These will set you back anything from 
£50 – £100 per door
, compared to 
uPVC French or patio doors
 which cost around 
£125 – £200 per pair 
to install.
As a rough ballpark cost, budget between £50 – £200 for door installation. Fire door installation cost If you’re looking to install a fire door, you’ll be looking at an average cost of around 
£300
 for supply and installation. Read more in our  fire door installation cost guide . Garage door installation cost The average cost of installing a new garage door ranges from 
£550 – £2,500
 – depending on the size, style, make and model of the garage door you choose. To find out more about prices, check out our guide to the  cost of replacing a garage door .

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now What is the cost of a new front door? The cost of a new front door will depend on a range of factors including the style, size and added accessories that you choose. A composite door installation for example, will cost more than a basic spec uPVC new front door.
The average cost of labour for installing a door ranges between 
£225 – £300
, but again, this will depend on the type and size of front door you have.
You will also need to factor in the cost of door frames and make sure that your door includes a weather bar.
Our door installation expert 
Andrew Finn of  Gray’s Locksmiths Ltd  says that, “
you must consider that the specifications of doors vary massively. You should carefully consider the quality of the door itself and more importantly what  fire rating  the door requires.
Every additional door option can add to the final cost and this can be significant when you consider all the different types of lock, door furniture and finish.” New front door cost factors The cost of a new front door will depend on a range of factors, including:
The materials
Front doors, or in fact any external doors, were traditionally made from timber. However, there are now a range of great materials you can choose from, including uPVC and composite doors.
The type of material you opt for can make a massive difference to the price of your door. However, there are other factors other than price which must be considered.
UPVC doors are made entirely from a plastic material and, although they are very strong, there is no denying that composite doors offer significantly more security; something which must never be compromised on. Composite doors are crafted from a variety of different materials, which are pressed and glued together under very extreme pressure conditions. They are chosen to counteract one another’s flaws, with a solid timber core and a combination of PVC, insulating foam and more to create what is a reliable and robust door.
The accessories
What accessories come with a door, you might ask? Well, what kind of handle are you looking for – what colours and materials will that be made from? What style of letterbox do you require? Do you require any additional security bolts? Any of these decisions can alter the price that you will pay and therefore, must be considered.
The mechanisms
The locking mechanism itself may alter the price that you pay. As standard, most modern doors from reputable suppliers will come with a secure locking system that meets the latest regulations. However, additional security measures can be added, including alternative locking systems. Although these may come at an additional cost, for anybody in a high-risk area or who is merely looking to be more cautious around their home security, this could be an essential investment.
The style
The style of the door must also be taken into account, as there are a wide variety of options available. A well-designed door can seriously enhance the aesthetic appeal of your property and so ensuring that you choose the right one is essential.
A panelled door may be suitable to provide you with the most privacy, but a windowed door can allow plenty of light into a dark hallway. Choosing the right design which complements the other elements of your home is a decision that shouldn’t be taken lightly. Letterbox installation cost Not all front doors come with built-in letterboxes, so you may need to buy one separately and have it fitted. As a ballpark, you can expect to pay between 
£30 – £80
 for letterbox installation (not including the cost of the letterbox).
The overall cost of letterbox installation will depend on the style and quality of the letterbox you choose, the type of door you’re having it fitted to and if you’re getting it fitted at the same time you have your front door installed.
Make sure to check with your door manufacturer before having a letterbox fitted that it doesn’t affect your guarantee. A tradesperson will be able to help advise you on this.

Find a carpenter near you  How long does it take to install a door? The average time to install external doors is around two to six hours.
The time it takes to install a door however does depend on several factors:
Whether the removal of the old door is included.
How many doors are being replaced.
The type of installation (e.g., patio doors will take longer to install than front doors).
Any customisation involved (e.g., if the frame needs resizing).
The actual installations shouldn’t take longer than a few hours, but we recommend you upgrade your doors when the weather is nicer to ensure your home is insulated in time for winter.

Skirting board fitting cost,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/skirting-board-fitting-cost/,Tag Not Found,"Skirting board fitting cost

In This Blog: How are skirting boards fitted? Cost for fitting skirting boards Additional costs to consider Can I fit skirting boards myself? Key insights Skirting boards, which are also known as baseboards, are decorative finishing touches that cover the joints between walls and floors. In this guide, we look at the average cost of fitting a skirting board in the UK – all prices included are meant to act as an estimate.
Whether you’ve moved into a new property or are renovating, redecorating or repairing your home, you might want to consider hiring a carpenter to repair or fit new skirting boards. We’re going to discuss how they’re fitted and the factors that make up the overall costs of their installation.
We spoke to the online estimators at  My Build Estimate  – a professional estimating company monitored by the  Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors  (RICS) regarding the costs in this guide.
We’ve also included key considerations for the purchase and process of fitting your skirting board. How are skirting boards fitted? Skirting boards are usually fitted by a carpenter using various tools, such as:
Mitre saw
Screws
Pins
Wood glue
Tape measure
Pencil
Hammer
Nail punch
Drill driver
Countersink bit
Plane
Coping saw
Skirting board and wall painted by  Sean Saunders Painting & Decorating After assessing your walls, they will take measurements and cut the skirting boards to size. Next, they’ll fix any studwork required and mark the location of the studs on your floor with a pencil.
Once everything is marked out, the carpenter will drill pilot holes through the skirting board and into the studs. Further cuts will be made for the screws to sit behind the surface before being screwed in.
Next, wood glue will be used along the join to push the skirting board into place, with further drilling and screwing required to firmly secure the boards.
Finally, a few pins will be nailed through the second piece into the first and then punched below the surface.
This process will be repeated, taking into account the corners, which require careful scribing for accuracy. Then, once the room is completed, a wood filler will be used to fill in the screw holes, leaving your skirting board ready for a coat of paint or varnish.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now The cost to install skirting boards can vary depending on the quality, material and size of the room they’re being fitted in. On average, you can expect carpenters to charge the cost of fitting skirting boards at a day rate of around 
£250
. This includes installation and painting your skirting boards. However, if you factor in the supply, fit and decoration, the average cost can jump up to 
£275
.
For bigger jobs, you can expect carpenters to charge by the metre. On average, a skirting board fitting cost per metre for a 4.3m x 3m room is 
£275
. Additional costs to consider The painting requirements of the skirting boards
Disposing of the old skirting boards
Any wall and/or floor preparation required
For example, gloss painting skirting boards in poor condition with lots of filler required will, on average, cost you around 
£300
.

Find a skirting board fitter near you  Can I fit skirting boards myself? Although many people attempt to  fit skirting boards  themselves, we always recommend hiring a professional.
The measuring, cutting, scribing and fixing needs a level of accuracy and skill to ensure the finished look is neat and tidy. A badly done job can equal gaps in corner joints and uneven fittings. It also takes longer and could cost you more in the long run. Search Checkatrade  for a qualified and trusted tradesperson who will ensure your skirting boards are fitted properly and professionally. Key insights All prices in this cost guide are based on standard 75mm skirting boards.
If you are using bigger/thicker skirting, then the overall price will increase.
If there are a lot of corners or difficult cuts in a room, then the cost of the skirting will also increase.

In This Blog: Space saving bedroom ideas Space saving ideas for small bedrooms What to put in an empty corner of a bedroom Space saving bedroom ideas and their costs There’s a reason you’re looking for space saving bedroom ideas. Space is a commodity these days. With square footage dwindling, house prices increasing, and city living squeezing in tower block after tower block, you need to get creative with storage.
One of the ways developers maximise space is to incorporate open plan living with reduced square footage in the rooms homeowners don’t use as much. That’s why bathrooms and bedrooms are the first to slim down. Their sacrifice makes way for a larger kitchen and living area for you to roam around in.
However, what this means is that you need to find a way to keep your bedroom clutter-free. Thankfully, there are a few ways to design your bedroom to maximise square footage and make the most of dead space. Read on for our expert advice to help you save space in your bedroom. Space saving bedroom ideas When it comes to what things to put in your room, there are two words that will help you save space and fill empty corners: bespoke storage.

The main items you want to store in your room are clothes, accessories and shoes. The rest of your bedroom tends to be used for decorative purposes or for items you don’t have a home for yet. That’s why a great option is to  hire a carpenter  and install a  fitted wardrobe . This not only saves space, but it’s a great way to manage your storage needs based on what you currently own. You can add shelves, shoe racks, poles, and hooks as required. Find out how much  fitted wardrobes cost .
Bespoke storage units
For items that don’t fit neatly in your wardrobe, a  bespoke storage unit  is perfect for keeping all other items off your floor. Consider making use of an awkward corner by adding a tall shelving unit with space for decorative boxes. Alternatively, include drawers in your storage and forgo a dressing unit. Another idea is to turn your units into a multi-purpose solution. For example, make an area with drawers, use the gap for a chair, and cupboards to hide anything else you’d like hidden.
Re-arrange your current design
Consider the layout of your bedroom and where you’re able to save space. For example, do you need a chest of drawers or could you replace them with a multi-purpose solution instead? Why not  hire a designer  to help rearrange your bedroom to make the most out of your layout?
Take a look at our guide on
 how to divide a room
 for inspiration.

Find carpenters your neighbours recommend  Space saving ideas for small bedrooms Here are a few things to put in a bedroom that has limited square footage.
Divan beds
As your bed takes up most of the floor space, a divan bed offers the perfect storage solution for your bedroom. Consider one with drawers on either side or one that opens up from the bottom. Even if a divan bed isn’t your preference, you can buy under-bed storage with wheels and compartments that add extra storage.
Tidies
Decluttering your room can be as simple as adding storage solutions in other storage solutions. For example, a compact charging station or ‘bed pocket’ that lets you hide your electronics and wires is great for hiding clutter. Also, why not add a drawer, cupboard, and wardrobe organisers that let you stack or separate items? This will make your belongings easier to find and limit the build-up of mess. Floating shelves One of the best tricks for saving space is to build upwards, not outwards.  Floating shelves  offer the perfect solution to design decor challenges while limiting how often you stub your toe. Consider incorporating floating shelves with drawer attachments instead of bedside tables. This will give the illusion of more space even if it doesn’t offer extra square footage. Alternatively, add floating shelves to a feature wall and fill them with books for a modern aesthetic.
Take a look at our  small bedroom ideas  for more ideas. What to put in an empty corner of a bedroom There are several space saving bedroom corner ideas that can maximise your floor space and make use of an awkward layout. Consider adding a tallboy or corner shelf to fill an empty corner and stack it with books, decorative boxes, or trinkets. Another way to dress a corner is to add an accent chair and floor-standing lamp to create a reading nook. If you’re not a huge reader, add a storage pouffe, ottoman, or chaise lounge. Other options include corner ‘snuggle’ chairs, bookcases, or hanging plants and picture frames. Space saving bedroom ideas and their costs Hire a handyperson  to help you build furniture, repair items, and put up shelves for around 
£20 – £30 per hour
.
Depending on the design of your  fitted wardrobes , expect to pay around 
£3,000 + labour
.
Most bespoke  alcove cupboards  will cost you an average of 
£2,250
.
Hiring an  interior designer  is likely to set your back around 
£100 per hour

Can a scratched wood floor be easily fixed?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/repair-scratched-wood-floor/,Living Room,"Can a scratched wood floor be easily fixed?

In This Blog: What to do if you have a scratched wood floor Wood floor scratch repair How to fix scratches on a wood floor How to repair a wood floor Laminate floor scratch repair How to get scratches out of laminate flooring Repairing a scratched vinyl floor Scratched wood floor repair costs Looking for tips on how to repair a scratched wood floor? Whether you have hardwood, laminate or wood effect vinyl flooring, here’s our guide to keeping them looking fresh.
The floors in our homes put up with a lot of wear and tear with daily use, so it is only natural that in time a wooden floor may need repairing. Heavy furniture with feet, chairs that get moved daily and heeled shoes can all be the cause for a scratched wood floor. What to do if you have a scratched wood floor Preventing scratches on a wooden floor can be as simple as applying felt to the feet of furniture and chairs, using rugs to cover the floor and implementing a ‘no shoes’ policy to protect from scratches on your wooden floor. If the damage is already done then there are a few options you can consider that we’ve covered below. If the scratch is really bad you may need to look at  hiring a professional  to replace your wooden floor. Wood floor scratch repair A scratch on a wooden floor could be something as simple as the result of moving a chair back and forth each day, which will cause a worn finish. Alternatively, you may have dropped a sharp object that a deep sharp scratch that may weaken the wood.
Before attempting any kind of wood floor scratch repair it is important to know the type of finish or treatment your wood floor has had, to know how to restore this finish. If you can, speak to whoever laid the flooring, or  contact a specialist  for them to take a look.

Find flooring specialists your neighbours recommend  How to fix scratches on a wood floor To start, clean the area by vacuuming and brushing with a soft cloth and use a special hardwood floor cleaner with a neutral PH. This will stop any further damage to the wood and help you to see the full extent of the damage.
To fix scratches on a wood floor you can use a special blending pencil for light scratches. Before using these make sure that they are at room temperature as this will make them easier to use. Use a series of pencil strokes to build the colour that you need.
Finish restorers can also be used to treat scuffs and minor scratches. This is good for covering larger areas to bring back the overall appearance of your wood floor. These products tend to be in a liquid form with different finish options for a more glossy or matte look. How to repair a wood floor If you have more obvious scratches that are larger or deeper, these can often be treated by re-coating or refinishing the floor. This type of floor repair is good for wooden floors that have previously been finished with oils. As this is a more specialist type of wood floor scratch repair this is a job best left for the  professionals .
Deeper or more widespread scratched wood floors may require professional sanding and refinishing. If there are deep gouges in the wood floor then some gap filling may be required. This is when a flooring specialist uses a mix of resin and sawdust to repair the damage.
Even though a scratched wood floor might seem simple enough to repair, it can be easy to make an expensive mistake so don’t experiment and always consult a professional. If you’ve got wooden floors throughout your home find out more about  wooden floor restoration costs . Laminate floor scratch repair As with a hardwood floor, if you’re attempting to get scratches out of wooden laminate flooring, always make sure the floor is clean and dry before attempting a repair.
Touch up markers and pencil kits that are ready to use products are available, and some flooring manufacturers have their own kits that you can buy. These laminate floor scratch repair kits normally come with two or three colours to help imitate the wood grain – it’s a bit like colouring in!
This is a quick and efficient method for repairing a scratched laminate floor but it isn’t a permanent solution as the touch up may fade over time. How to get scratches out of laminate flooring Another option for a scratched wood floor is to use wood wax. Again kits are typically available from manufacturers.
If you’re using wax, you will need to heat it up and use the special applicator that comes with the kit to apply it. This method can be fiddly and requires a lot of attention and patience. For the best finish, use a putty knife to create a flat surface to make sure the repair blends in.
Similarly, you can use ‘burn in’ sticks. These are similar to wax but are designed for deeper scratches. The sticks need to be heated and are then applied like a filler. Again this requires patience and needs to be left to dry.
For deep scratches, you may need to use coloured putty. This putty is available to buy but does require a certain level of skill as it is hard to remove dry putty without causing more damage to the floor. After applying the putty, make sure the area is smoothed flat for the best finish.
If the initial scratch is really bad it might be past the point of repair and you might need to replace a plank. In this case, it’s best to reach out to a professional for advice. For more details on cost take a look at our  laminate floor fitting cost guide .

Find flooring specialists your neighbours recommend  Repairing a scratched vinyl floor Vinyl has come a long way and some wood effect vinyl even has a raised grain that looks really realistic. Vinyl can be more prone to scratches though, so here are some tips if you’ve got a scratched vinyl floor.
Clean the area with mild detergent and a soft cloth.
Use 2-3 different grades of sandpaper to smooth any rough edges. Go from courser to finer (P320, P500, P800) and rub gently in circular movements.
Clean again to remove any dust.
Apply a good quality wax to finish. Use a small amount on a clean cloth and use small circular movements.
Wipe clean with a clean dry cloth.
Other products such as a PU cleaner or a repair pen are also available to touch up smaller scratches. It’s also possible to fix deep vinyl floor scratches with liquid sealant.
If the damage is extensive to your scratched vinyl floor you might require a partial replacement, and if this is the case then seek advice from a professional to get a seamless finish. Get an idea of costs in our  vinyl flooring cost guide . Scratched wood floor repair costs If you require the services of a flooring specialist to repair your scratched wood floor, sanding and varnishing will cost between 
£150 – £650
 per room, depending on the size of your room. If you have deep gauges on your wooden floor then gap filling will cost from 
£40 – £750
 depending on the size of the job. In addition to these costs, you will also need to pay for the labour charge which you can expect to cost 
£250 per day
 on average.
A flooring specialist may advise that your wood floor needs replacing rather than just a repair, and if this is the case the costs for removing a wooden floor are approximately 
£200 per room
, plus potentially the cost of rubbish removal. For a detailed look at the cost of a new wooden floor, see our  wooden flooring cost guide .
Hopefully, this has given you some options to consider if you need to repair your wood floor. If in doubt, always contact a  flooring expert  to get their advice.

Types of loft conversions: What’s best?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/types-of-loft-conversions/,Loft,"Types of loft conversions: What’s best?

In This Blog: Types of loft conversions Cost for types of loft conversions How long does a conversion take? How to hire a tradesperson Feeling overwhelmed by all the different types of loft conversions to choose from? Like all home improvement projects, there are numerous options for you to consider before committing to one. But with the current space shortage, adding an extra room (or two) is a great way to increase your home’s square footage without forfeiting your garden.
We’re going to take a look at the most common and popular designs homeowners opt for. We’ll also cover the benefits and costs of each conversion so you can decide on the best option that works for you.
Check out our  loft conversion planning guide  for further expert advice. Types of loft conversions Most loft conversions fall under what’s known as ‘ permitted development ‘ unless you live in a grade-listed building, a conservation area, or your roof isn’t tall enough to accommodate a conversion. In these cases, it’s best to  hire a surveyor  or  ask a builder  to check whether you need to ask for permission from your local authority.
Check out if your  loft is suitable for conversion .
However, if you know you’re able to go ahead, then your only worry is what type of loft conversion you’d like to install. Thankfully, there are plenty to choose from.
Dormer loft conversion
Dormer conversions are the most popular due to their versatility. For homes with a pitched roof, they fit almost anywhere. Dormers are essentially ‘box’ structures with windows secured at 90-degree angles. They add headspace, floor space, and most importantly, breathing room.
Common dormer options include:
Double dormer loft conversions are two dormers fixed onto a pitched roof, offering plenty of light and extra floor space.
L-shaped dormer loft conversions come in two parts that form an L-shape and often ‘wrap’ around the roof.
Rear dormer loft conversions sit at the back of your house instead of the front.
Full-width dormer loft conversions are when an entire structure is fitted along the length of your pitched roof, often with a wide window. This is more common in contemporary homes.
Side dormer loft conversions are fitted at the side of your home, often in a ‘dog-house’ shape.
Mansard loft conversion
Mansard loft conversions are popular because they allow property owners to maximise their square footage.
Similar to a full-width dormer, they’re often built at the rear of a home. However, to support a heavy mansard structure, planning permission is likely needed. This is due to the roof alterations likely required, and also because of the roof shape changes. Mansard conversions alter the angle of a roof to an almost vertical position.
Roof light loft conversion
Roof light conversions are increasingly popular due to their ease of installation. Windows and ventilators are installed in the existing roofline, which turns the loft into a usable room. They don’t add any extra square footage; however, they add light and ventilation to make the space liveable.
Hip-to-gable loft conversion
Homeowners often choose hip-to-gable loft conversions because of their relatively low cost when compared with other roof conversions that add square footage. Hip-to-gables extend the slope of your hip roof to create a gable. Semi-detached properties benefit from this conversion the most because they tend to have hipped roofs already.

Hire a builder your neighbours recommend  Cost for types of loft conversions The cost of your conversion will depend on the size, complexity, and type of design you require. Here are some ballpark averages of common conversions:
Dormer conversions cost an average of 
£45,000
Hip-to-gable-conversions cost an average of 
£55,000
Mansard conversions cost an average of 
£57,500
Read more about  loft conversion costs  in our handy guide. How long does a conversion take? Dormer conversions take an average of 10-12 weeks to complete
Hip-to-gable-conversions take an average of 10-12 weeks to complete
Mansard conversions take an average of 8-10 weeks to complete
Please note that these timescales are only estimates. For a more accurate estimation, ask for a quote from one of our  loft conversion specialists . For more comprehensive information take a look at our guide on  how long you can expect your conversion to take . How to hire a tradesperson Knowing whether to hire an architect or a builder is entirely dependent on the complexity of your conversion. However, the first place to start is research. This includes talking to friends and neighbours, checking out local forums, and of course,  looking at our trusted professionals .

Should you repair or replace windows?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/repair-or-replace-windows/,Tag Not Found,"Should you repair or replace windows?

In This Blog: Should I repair or replace my windows? Cost of window repairs Cost of window replacements Other helpful advice Are you wondering if you should repair or replace your windows? You’ve come to the right place. We’ve pulled together everything there is to know about replacing or repairing your windows, what to look out for, and the costs associated with each option.
Often, the decision to repair or replace comes down to the type of issue your windows are suffering from. For example, you might just need to reseal your windows to fix a draught; however, if the draught is due to structural wear and tear, a replacement might be your only option.
We’ll cover the common questions homeowners have, including the typical costs. Don’t forget to check out our  broken window emergency repair tips  if your situation is dire and you need a quick solution to tide you over until a  professional  can service you. Should I repair or replace my windows? There are several ways to work out whether to repair or replace windows. We’re going to cover the most common issues below.
Damp or mould
If water manages to seep into your home, it’s clear there’s an issue with your windows’ waterproofing. Sometimes water manages to find its way between the gaps of your double glazing, which is another sign that not all is as it should be.
If left untreated, this build-up of water can lead to mould or rot, which further damages your windows and makes repairs or replacements more expensive. For minor damp issues, you might only need to reseal your windows. However, for larger issues such as rot or heavy mould, a replacement is likely required.
Read our  mould removal cost guide  for more information.
Damage or cracks
Regardless of whether it’s the frame or the glass, any damage needs to be addressed as quickly as possible. Replacing a windowpane is simple enough. However, if parts such as the frame, casing, or lintels are damaged, a replacement will save you a bigger headache further down the line.
Reduced soundproofing Double glazing  has multiple benefits, including blocking out sound. So, if your windows aren’t muffling the noise of traffic or outside hustle and bustle, it’s time to replace your double glazing (or upgrade to  triple glazing !)
Difficult to open and close
As new houses settle, windows often need readjusting after a few months. However, if your house isn’t a new build or you’ve been living in it for a while, it may be time to replace your windows.
Over time, heat, cold, pressure, and general wear and tear erode your windows and cause them to misalign or warp. Sometimes the problem is a simple fix, such as a readjustment, reseal, or deep clean. However, it could also be because of wood rot, swelling, or degradation, which will require a replacement to correct.
Blown window
Blown windows are common problems for homes with double-glazed windows. It’s easily diagnosed by the build-up of mist or condensation appearing between the glass panes of your double or triple glazing. If it isn’t repaired asap, issues can range from a loss of heat to compromised home security.
If you’re unable to diagnose the underlying issue with your windows yourself, it’s worth  hiring a professional  to come and check them for you. When you hire a Checkatrade tradesperson, you can be safe in the knowledge that they’ve been checked by us and reviewed by your neighbours.

Hire window experts your neighbours recommend  Cost of window repairs Now you know what kinds of issues to look out for, let’s look at the potential costs for each problem. Repairs are often cheaper than replacements, but before you commit to a restoration, make sure that’s all your windows need. Otherwise, you could be looking at more expensive costs later down the line. Remember: prevention is better than cure! Most window seal repairs  are actually replacement seals that cost an average of 
£55 per window,
 including labour.
If you’re looking for an emergency window repair, it’s probably because there’s a major issue. The cost will depend on the extent of the damage, but you’re looking at upwards of 
£120
 for the labour alone. To repair a blown window,  costs will depend on the size of your window, which ranges from 
£55 – £145
 for small to large m

.
Depending on the material used, a  window frame repair  costs an average of anywhere between 
£172
 and 
£290
. Cost of window replacements Window glass replacement  or windowpane replacements cost an average of 
£100
 per window + labour. The cost of a window sash replacement  averages around
 £1,300
 per window. However, for sash windows that only need restoring, the costs are as low as
 £80
.
Most standard  window sill replacement cost in the UK  averages around
 £180, 
rising to 
£230 
for sash windows. Other helpful advice We understand times are tough and saving money by completing tasks yourself is tempting. And that’s why we’ve put together some helpful how-tos to help homeowners make sure their DIY projects are successful. Our  ‘how to fix a window’  guide is one such resource.

Fixing a leaking gutter joint,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/leaking-gutter-joint/,Roof,"Fixing a leaking gutter joint

In This Blog: What causes a leaking gutter joint? How to fix a leaking gutter joint How to fix guttering that’s come loose How to fix gutters that leak at the end How to fix gutters that overflow How much does sealing gutter joints cost? A leaking gutter joint is not to be ignored. It’s one of those jobs where the quicker you take action, the better.
Why? Because the main role of guttering is to collect rainwater that runs off the roof, direct it to the downpipe, and away into a drainage system.
Without effective guttering, the rainwater will run down the side of your property, pooling at the base. This can cause soil erosion and flooding of basements and other areas of your home. Worse case, it could even threaten the structural foundations.
Guttering installed in the last 10 years should have a lifespan of up to 30 years. If it breaks and is fixable, then it’ll be more economical and environmentally friendly to get it repaired rather than having to  replace a leaking gutter joint . What causes a leaking gutter joint? Common reasons for a leaking gutter joint include:
Natural wear and tear
. Over time, your gutter joints will deteriorate, meaning that the seal between the two sections of guttering (the gutter union) is less effective, causing a leak.
Blockages
. As well as rainwater, your gutters will collect leaves and debris. If your gutters aren’t cleared out regularly, the debris will create a blockage, causing rainwater to overflow. This can also damage the gutter due to the excess weight upon it.

Find a gutter repair specialist your neighbours recommend  How to fix a leaking gutter joint You will need:
An extension ladder
A bucket, sponge, and warm soapy water
A dry cloth
Heavy-duty gloves
You may also need a replacement gutter union. A gutter union is used to join two sections of guttering together. It has a clip and rubber gaskets (seals) that create a watertight join.
Remember, working at height can be extremely dangerous. Please make sure you take all necessary safety precautions.
If in any doubt, please  contact a specialist  who’s experienced in how to repair gutters safely and professionally.
Step 1
Carefully position your ladder at a safe angle for accessing the section of guttering you’ll be working with. Modern ladders will often have a safety mark on the side to demonstrate this.
Never overstretch to reach the guttering.
Never stand on the top two steps of the ladder.
Make sure you always have three points of contact with the ladder at all times.
Step 2
Carefully scrape out and remove any dirt and debris from the gutter.
Step 3
Gently unclip the gutter union and clean it with warm soapy water and a sponge at ground level.
Make sure the gaskets (seals) are completely free of dirt or debris.
Dry the union and set aside.
Step 4
Take a clean cloth and remove any silicone from the ends of the two sections of exposed guttering.
Step 5
Replace the gutter union by clipping it back in place, fitting it back up to the expansion line.
Step 6
You can test whether this has fixed the leak by running some water down into the guttering with a hose.
If the gutter joint is still leaking, you will need to buy and install a replacement gutter union.
Top tip: If you’re at all unsure, then we highly recommend  hiring a professional  to come and do the repairs.

Find a gutter repair specialist your neighbours recommend  How to fix guttering that’s come loose If your guttering becomes loose from the  fascia , it will sag, causing water to pool and then overflow. The weight of the pooling water can also cause the gutter to crack.
To fix this
, simply check the gutter support brackets are firmly screwed into the fascia. Make sure your guttering is angled to fall away towards the downpipe so that rainwater can travel along the gutter efficiently. How to fix gutters that leak at the end If you notice water leaking from the end of the guttering, the stop end (the piece at the end of the guttering) is likely to be either damaged or missing.
To fix this
, inspect the stop end as per the instructions for gutter joint repair (above). If the stop end is damaged or missing, you can install a new stop end so the water is diverted to the downpipe. Make sure the level of the gutter falls away from the stop end, i.e. towards the downpipe. How to fix gutters that overflow If your gutters overflow, it’s likely due to a blockage preventing the rainwater from draining away as it should.
To fix this
, follow our advice above to position your ladder safely, and remove the dirt and debris from the guttering. To help reduce future blockages, install a leaf guard or a leaf brush. How much does sealing gutter joints cost? The best way to repair a leaking gutter joint is to call in a professional, who has the necessary equipment and training to work safely at height, and seal the gutter joints to a high standard.
Leaking  gutter joint repair costs  are normally in the region of 
£60 – £90

Can broken blinds be fixed?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/broken-blinds-problem-solve/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Can broken blinds be fixed?

In This Blog: Can broken blinds be repaired? First decision – repair or replace your broken blinds? How to fix blinds string on horizontal blinds How to fix the pull cord on horizontal blinds How to fix vertical blinds How to fix a roller blind chain How to fix shutters How much does it cost to repair broken blinds? Window blinds work hard to offer us privacy, shield us from bright sunlight, and provide an extra layer of insulation.
Although relatively hard-wearing, window blinds are used so frequently, so it’s inevitable to have to fix broken blinds at some point. It may be either due to wear and tear or damage. Can broken blinds be repaired? You may be glad to know, blinds can be repaired in most cases.
Keep reading as we’ll guide you through how blinds are fixed. We’ll also teach you how to fix blinds of all varieties, including horizontal blinds, vertical blinds, roller blinds, and shutters. First decision – repair or replace your broken blinds? It’s often cheaper to  repair  than to replace a broken blind. But this depends on the damage and condition of your blind.
And generally speaking, it’s better for the environment to repair an item where possible, as it reduces the waste that goes to landfill.
In the section below, we’ll guide you through how to fix blinds (either DIY or what a  tradesperson  may do), focusing on some of the most common issues homeowners face.

Too hard for DIY? Find a tradesperson  How to fix blinds string on horizontal blinds If your horizontal blinds no longer go up and down as they should, there could be a problem with the blind string.
You can buy a repair kit from your local DIY store if you’re confident to give this a go yourself.
Alternatively, you can  call in a professional blind fitter  to repair your blinds for you. 
First, examine the blinds to identify any broken strings. Take a moment to look at how the strings are attached to the blind.
Carefully remove the blind from the window. Normally, once you take off the cover at the top of your blind you can open the clips and lift the blind out.
Lay the blind on a flat surface.
At the bottom of the blind, there are caps that cover the cords. Open the relevant cap and gently pull out the broken string.
Once the broken blind string has been removed, feed the new replacement string through the hole where the cap was.
Tip:
 for single string blinds the replacement string needs to be two times the length of the blind + the width. If your blind has a double string, the replacement string needs to be three times the length + the width.
The string then needs to go through the holes in each blind slat, weaving over and under the ladder strings all the way to the top of the blind.For blinds with a single string (typically on metal blinds) weave over and under the ladder string every three slats.For blinds with a double string (more common with wooden/ faux wood blinds) weave over and under the ladder string on each slat. (The ladder strings are the thin strings the blinds sit on).
Tie a knot in the blind string at the bottom of the blind, cut off the excess and replace the cap.
Take the top of the blind string and push it through the headrail and into the pulley. Now tie the string to the other pull cord ends. If you find this fiddly, use a pair of pliers to help you.
Test the new blind string works and fix the blind back in place on the window.
Tip:
 use a lighter on the ends of the blind strings to stop them from fraying. 

Too hard for DIY? Find a tradesperson  How to fix the pull cord on horizontal blinds Here’s our step-by-step for how to fix a blind cord. This is the part of the blind responsible for drawing the blinds up and down, fixed at the end by a tassle.
Measure the length of replacement cord you need. Scroll up for our tip on how to calculate this.
Follow the steps above to remove the blind from the window, lay the blind on a flat surface, and remove the relevant cap on the underside of the bottom slat.
With the cap removed you can gently pull the old cord out a little.
Connect the new cord to the old cord using a lighter to melt the two ends together. Roll the cords in between your thumb and finger to weld the two pieces together.
Carefully pull the old cord to guide the new cord up through the blinds towards the headrail and out through the pulley.
Continue doing this until the new has completely replaced the old and you have the desired length of pull cord hanging out of the headrail at the top of the blind.
Cut the cord where you connected the two pieces with the lighter. Feed the pull cord through the pull tassle and tie a knot to secure it in place.
Tie a knot in the other end of the new cord on the underside of the blind and replace the cap.
Fix the blind back in place on the window.
Please make sure you follow the government advice on  child safety devices for blinds that have a looped cord . How to fix vertical blinds Some of the common repairs for vertical blinds include repairing a broken pull cord, replacing broken carrier clips, restringing the blinds, and replacing broken valance clips.
While it is possible to buy a blind repair kit to attempt these jobs yourself, vertical blinds can be sizable and heavy and can therefore prove quite tricky to work with.
We advise contacting a  professional blind fitter  to complete the repairs for you.
To learn how to fix the pull cord on vertical blinds where the cord has fallen out of the headrail, read on.
Remove the headrail cover.
Using a ladder, climb up so you can see down into the headrail.
Rethread the string up through the hole in the underside of the headrail.
Fix a pull tassel to the end of the cord and tie a knot to secure in place.

Too hard for DIY? Find a tradesperson  How to fix a roller blind chain Here’s how to fix a roller blind chain that has broken or come off its tracks. 
Remove the roller blind from its fixings. You can normally do this by pushing in the pin on the opposite side of the chain.
With the blind removed, take the clutch off the end of the blind. This is the part that has the chain on it.
Remove the connector from the chain if there is one and pull the chain out of the clutch.
Holding the clutch so that the barrel is at the top and the base facing down, take your replacement chain and feed it into the left side of the clutch.
Press the chain into the pulley teeth.
Rotate the pulley teeth and pop the chain into the teeth as you turn it.
The chain should now come out of the right side of the clutch.
Put the clutch back on the blind and rehang the blind in position.
Connect the two ends of the new chain with the connector. How to fix shutters If you have a damaged or broken slat in your shutter blind, we recommend you contact a  professional shutter blind installer  for your repairs. Shutter blinds are costly, and the last thing you want to do is cause more damage while trying to do the repair yourself.
If you do wish to go ahead, you will need to: 
Snip off the staple that attaches the broken slat to the push rod. You will need pliers for this.
Then, take a wallpaper scraper and ease it between the end of the broken slat and the inside frame of the shutter.
The slat should come away from the shutter.
Remove the pins from either end of the slat. One is fixed and one is spring-loaded.
Insert the fixed pin into one end of the new slat and fix this end in place.
Insert the spring-loaded pin into the shutter frame. Depress the pin so you can slide the slat in place.
Insert your replacement staple through the staple on the push rod. Apply a little superglue to the end of the staple and push it into the holes in the slat. How much does it cost to repair broken blinds? The good news is, it’s cheaper to repair broken blinds rather than replace them.

How to find a renovation contractor,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/hiring-guides/find-renovation-contractors/,"Bathroom, Kitchen, Living Room","How to find a renovation contractor

In This Blog: Find a renovation contractor How to find a home renovation contractor Hire a renovator Knowing how and where to find a renovation contractor is the difference between panic-hiring a building team and thoughtfully considering your options.
You wouldn’t hire a photographer for your wedding day without making sure the life-long photos are going to be wall-worthy. And just like your home, choosing the wrong contractor/s for your renovation can have lasting consequences you can’t look away from. Find a renovation contractor Embarking on a home renovation journey is an exciting prospect. There’s nothing quite as satisfying as turning tired, drab, or dated rooms into personal sanctuaries. It’s all part of the fun, which is why it’s important you find the 
best
 renovator (or renovators – plural) to help you.
The last thing you want to do is cut corners or hire the wrong people for the job.
For example, some contractors specialise in kitchen renovations, while others have more experience in building extensions or landscaping gardens, so choosing the right fit will result in happier outcomes.
So, the first question you want to ask yourself is: 
what kind of renovation do I want and what aesthetic am I going for?
Once you know the answer to this question, you can start to search for your ideal contractor.
As a rough guide, you’ll need to consider the following tradespeople for the following jobs:
Bathroom renovation:
 Plumber, builder, and tiler
Bedroom renovation:
 Builder, painter & decorator, carpenter, and handyman (for putting together furniture, etc.)
Kitchen renovation:
 Plumber, electrician, tiler, builder, and painter & decorator
Garden renovation:
 Gardener, landscaper, builder, and handyman
Extension:
 Builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, and painter & decorator
Check out our  how-to-find a good contractor for remodelling  blog for more information.

Find renovation contractors your neighbours rate  How to find a home renovation contractor Once you know who you need to hire, when, and for what, there are several ways to find your perfect renovation contractor.
Find tradespeople recommended by your neighbours online
You might think word of mouth is a good recommendation, but it’s not. A word of mouth recommendation alone can’t be entirely trusted. It’s just one recommendation. You’ve got to do your own research.
The best place to check for neighbourly recommendations is on an online trade directory like us!
All of our checked members on our website have customer reviews (recommendations from your neighbours), a star rating, and a portfolio of their work. Better yet, several members are backed by  our guarantee  (T&Cs apply) to offer you greater peace of mind.
Did you know you can use our free search feature to instantly find a range of contractors in your area?
By checking online reviews
You don’t just have to take our word for it. Be sure to check a company’s reviews by checking online and looking at their website. If there are any red flags, you’ll be sure to find them!
Asking to see a portfolio of work
Going in blind without seeing a contractor’s body of work is risky. That’s why many of our trusted tradespeople have a portfolio of work on our site, which includes before and after photos of previous projects.
Alternatively, many use Instagram to showcase their renovation skills. This is also a great way to get inspired. If you see something you like, it’s as simple as asking for a similar design!
Don’t forget, you can see their portfolio on our website if they’re a Checkatrade member.
Gathering quotes
We recommend  comparing 3-4 quotes  from various tradespeople to get a well-rounded idea of costs.
You can also check out our following guides for more information around costs and benefits: How much does it cost to renovate a house? How to budget for a home renovation in 6 easy steps The benefits of home remodelling contractors Reviewing contracts
Once you’ve gathered your quotes, make sure you review any contracts, references, and terms and conditions. You also want to make sure they have insurance, warranties, and/or are a member of a trade organisation like Checkatrade.
Make sure they’re able to carry out the work you need within a reasonable timeframe too.
And don’t forget to invite them round for an initial meet and greet, which also gives you the option of asking follow-up questions.

Find renovation contractors your neighbours rate  Hire a renovator Once you’ve narrowed down your options, there are several key questions to ask yourself (and/or your contractor).
Can they also project manage? If so, does this incur an extra fee?
Is the project plan detailed and laid out step-by-step?
Are the quoted costs transparent and easy to understand?
What are the payment terms?
Are there any hidden fees?
What’s included in the price?
Is there a comprehensive break-down of costs?
Have timeframes been given for the completion of works?
Do they have references?
Have both parties agreed and signed the contract?
Remember, hiring a professional contractor is supposed to be simple and stress-free.
So, check in with yourself and go with your gut feeling. If alarm bells are ringing or you’ve entered red-flag territory, you probably haven’t found the right fit for your project.
You’re going to have to work with any contractor you choose for at least a month, so make sure you manage this step from the very beginning to avoid issues further down the line.
Check out our  house renovation checklist  for a comprehensive and handy guide.

Roller shutter repair – common issues and fixes,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/roller-shutter-repair/,Garage,"Roller shutter repair – common issues and fixes

In This Blog: Roller shutter repair – common problems Roller shutter repair – simple fixes Emergency roller shutter repair Roller shutter motor repair Roller shutter repair cost FAQs Roller shutter repair is inevitable. Whether you have roller shutters on your home or a commercial property, these hard working pieces of equipment eventually give in to wear and tear. We’re taking a look at the common reasons why you might need your roller shutters repaired and how to get yours fixed. Roller shutter repair – common problems Roller shutters fall into two main categories – manual or motorised. Each type tends to have its own common problems but they can be broadly summarised into these main issues:
Shutters won’t fully open or close
Overheating
Sticking or screeching
Shutters only opening or closing halfway
Wear and tear Roller shutter repair – simple fixes Looking at these common issues, here are some simple tips for DIY roller shutter repair.
Opening and closing
If your roller shutter is having difficulty opening or closing, if it is motorised the first thing to check is if the power source is working. A failsafe tip for anything with a power source is to turn it off and back on again to see if this fixes the issue.
Overheating
If your roller shutter is in constant use then it may get too hot and end up overheating. Leave it for a while before trying again. If this doesn’t solve the problem then it is time to call in a professional as the motor may have burnt out.
Screeching and sticking
Is your roller shutter giving you a headache with its screeching and sticking? This indicates that your roller shutter needs some lubrication. A simple fix is to line the rails with WD40.
Are your shutters only opening or closing halfway? This suggests that the proximity sensors may be dirty or misaligned. As a starting point for repair, clean the sensors thoroughly and try again.
Wear and tear
Finally, your roller shutters may have succumbed to general wear and tear from constant use. Being open to the elements means they can get dented or cracked and this can cause problems with rail alignment or mean that the roller shutter gets stuck and cannot move as it should.
If none of these fixes seem to do the trick then you will need to hire a shutter specialist.

Find roller shutter specialists your neighbours recommend  Emergency roller shutter repair There may be a situation where your roller shutter fails and you need an emergency repair. If you have a motorised roller shutter you may be able to manually override the switch to help you to get in or out of your home or premises.
If the roller shutter is completely unusable and it is unsafe to delay the repair then it’s time to call the professionals. A roller shutter specialist can come out to your property and inspect the shutter and discuss the options with you and decide whether it can be repaired immediately or if more work is needed.
We’ll look at the costs in just a moment but it is worth mentioning here that if you require emergency or same-day repair you will need to pay an emergency call out fee on top of any repair costs.
As an important side note, industrial and commercial roller shutter doors are classed as machinery and should be serviced every 6 months to ensure that they are fully functioning and operating safely. Roller shutter motor repair If you have motorised roller shutters, the most common problems include a loss of power, build up of dirt or debris, or a motor failure.
Electric motors can burn out due to faulty wiring or can just stop working due to old age and constant use. As with most things, prevention is better than cure, so the best way to prevent roller shutter motor problems is by getting your roller shutter serviced and maintained regularly by a shutter specialist.
To prevent the need for motor repair, be sure to check your shutter after bad weather, keep the tracks lubricated and free of any dirt, debris, or obstructions. You should also regularly check the power button and the surrounding area for any signs of damage.
If you notice any burn or scorch marks, melted or warped plastic, or notice any unusual smells when operating your shutter, then these are definite signs that you need to contact a shutter specialist to take a look.

Find roller shutter specialists your neighbours recommend  Roller shutter repair cost Now let’s go over the average roller shutter repair costs. Depending on the size, material, and operation type, you could expect to pay anywhere from 
£400 – £2,500
 to replace a roller shutter. If you have a roller or sectional garage door, take a look at our  sectional garage door cost guide .
For a roller shutter motor repair, you’re looking at an average cost of 
£180
.
If you require an emergency roller shutter repair then a same-day emergency call out fee will cost approximately 
£125
 plus a charge of 
£62 per hour
.
When it comes to roller shutter repair costs, the total price will depend on the severity of the damage, how long it will take to fix, and the materials needed. FAQs How do you fix a stuck roller shutter?
This will depend on the operation type of your shutter. If it is manually operated then check there is no debris or anything caught on the guide rails that might be causing the shutter to be stuck. If you can’t see anything then try lubricating the rails.
If you have a motorised shutter then try turning the power on and off again, look for any signs of wear and tear or obstructions and clean any sensors that might be preventing the shutter from moving.
If you still have a problem, seek the advice of a shutter specialist.
Do roller shutters need servicing?
If you have shutters in an industrial or commercial setting then you will need to get them serviced every 6 months to ensure they are operating safely.
Even if you have shutters at home, it would still be advisable to get them serviced annually to prevent any sudden problems or catch any small issues before they become a problem.

Weather
. Sometimes changes in the weather can cause changes to the door itself – shrinking, contracting, and expanding. This can make locking and unlocking your uPVC door difficult.
Improper use
. Naturally, using excessive force with a uPVC door risks breaking the door. In this case, it’s likely the door lock mechanism will need to be replaced.

How to fix a uPVC door lock due to a faulty handle
Try the door handle as you normally would. If it feels unusually loose or floppy, this could be an easy fix.
Locate the barrel part of the door lock. This is the part where your key is inserted.
To tighten the handle, find the screws that hold the barrel of the lock in place and tighten them with a screwdriver.
This action will tighten up the door handle, fixing the problem with the door lock.

It’s not advised to use WD-40 on door locks, as the oil residue can cause problems with the lock in the future. How much does it cost to repair a uPVC door lock? A  professional locksmith  will know how to repair a uPVC door lock efficiently, quickly putting your mind at ease.

LVT vs laminate flooring – what’s best?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/lvt-vs-laminate/,Kitchen,"LVT vs laminate flooring – what’s best?

In This Blog: What is luxury vinyl tile (LVT)? What is laminate flooring? The difference between LVT and laminate LVT vs laminate flooring – pros and cons LVT vs laminate cost comparison LVT or laminate – conclusion Two of the most popular flooring options on the market are luxury vinyl tile (LVT) and laminate. Both are well-established and have their pros and cons, but which one is right for your project?
In this guide, we’ll explain what these two types of flooring are, before taking you through the differences between the two materials, their pros and cons and typical installation costs. What is luxury vinyl tile (LVT)? Luxury vinyl tile or LVT planks are traditionally made of a plastic core, which makes them flexible and soft. They come in a range of colours and designs, including mimicking wood and stone. Recent advances in LVT technology have resulted in SPC (Stone Plastic Composite) vinyl, which features a more rigid core and offers increased durability and design possibilities. What is laminate flooring? The original low-cost alternative to wood, laminate planks are made up of several layers of pressed wood pulp and topped with a durable plastic layer. Laminate flooring is available in a variety of colours and designs and typically features a ‘click’ style fitting technique, making it easy to install. The difference between LVT and laminate To look at them on a floor, you might struggle to see the difference between LVT and laminate, but there are quite a few things to be aware of before you make a decision on your flooring project:
Laminate is made from wood pulp and resin with a plastic top layer, whereas LVT is made from plastic or a stone plastic composite.
Laminate is a floating floor, which means it should never be glued or nailed down. LVT can both be glued and float.
Laminate is typically between 6mm and 12mm thick, whereas LVT ranges from 1.5mm to 5mm for luxury vinyl planks.
Manufacturer warranties tend to be longer on LVT compared to laminate, due to higher levels of durability.
Cost-wise, basic LVT is similar to laminate, but choose luxury vinyl tile and you’ll be paying considerably more.
While the differences may not seem significant, there are lots of pros and cons due to the variations in the makeup of LVT and laminate flooring.
A professional can always advise which is the best option for your specific project.
 Enter your postcode below to get quotes from locally recommended flooring specialists.

Find a flooring specialist recommended by your neighbours  LVT vs laminate flooring – pros and cons If you’re wondering which is better – LVT or laminate, then it really depends which factor you’re looking at:
Durability
 – While both are very hard-wearing, LVT wins in this department over laminate as it’s less likely to show signs of surface wear and its layers are more resilient to separation.
Water-resistance
 – This is LVT’s trump card. Laminate is made from a wood fibre core that will soften and deform if exposed to water for prolonged periods, whereas LVT is made from plastic, which can be submerged in water with no effect on its integrity or form.
Heat resistance
 – You might think LVT is the winner here, too, but laminate offers superior resistance to direct heat. Both will handle high room temperatures well, although LVT can have upper limits of around 27 degrees due to its plastic core.
Warranty period
 – Advances in flooring technology mean that high-quality LVT and laminate products will come with warranties of around 15 years in residential settings and around 5 years in commercial environments. Although on the whole, LVT warranties will be longer.
Appearance
 – The thicker structure of laminate allows for deeper and more rich surface designs, which is excellent for mimicking wood. However, luxury LVT will match this and also offer textured finishes that can be felt underfoot. The downside is, all those mini-ridges can catch dirt, especially in a kitchen!
Cleaning 
– LVT is waterproof, so no surprise that it can handle wet mopping without any damage. The same cannot be said for laminate, which is best cleaned with a brush and almost dry-to-the-touch mop. When it comes to stains, laminate will resist better than LVT, but LVT can be scrubbed more vigorously.
Installation
 – Both LVT can be installed by a DIYer, however, the finish can make or break the look of a room, which is why it’s always a good idea to get a flooring professional in to do the job to the highest standard.
Comfort and sound
 – Neither will replicate the feel of solid wood flooring underfoot, but laminate will have more of a natural feel than LVT owing to its composition. The sub-base and underlay you use can have a real impact here, so consider screeding and investing in a high-quality foam layer.
Sustainability
 – In terms of environmental impact, neither LVT nor laminate can be considered green, but laminate has the edge due to its wood fibre content, which in some cases can be from recycled sources. That said, LVT is likely to last longer and withstand being removed and relaid in a new property, which gives it a longer life through reuse.
As you can see, luxury vinyl tile and laminate flooring have numerous pros and cons, which can make deciding between the two tricky. For many homeowners, it comes down to their individual needs, and of course, cost. LVT vs laminate cost comparison Average  LVT flooring prices  range from 
£20 – £50 per square metre
 depending on the quality, with luxury vinyl tile being at the higher end. If you want a more unique pattern such as Herringbone, then you’ll pay up to 
£60
per square metre 
on average. Underlay will come in at around 
£7 per square metre
 and professional installation will start at around 
£250
a day
 on average.
In general,  laminate flooring  is cheaper than LVT with prices ranging from around 
£18 – £31 per square metre
 for supply and installation. Underlay will set you back around 
£5
per square metre
 and the cost of installation at a day rate will start at around 
£175
on average
. LVT or laminate – conclusion Taking into account all of the differences, benefits and drawbacks of both LVT and laminate, the right choice for your home depends on your individual project and desires. Flooring is always a very personal purchase and if you want a specific design, then all of these pros and cons may go out of the window!
In general, if you’re buying flooring for a kitchen or bathroom, then LVT will be the preference due to the fact that it’s completely waterproof and is easier to clean. Some LVT flooring also features antibacterial properties. However, if you’re flooring a lounge or dining room, then laminate offers a greater range and depth of designs that can give you the dream look you’re after.
Always hire a professional
While LVT and laminate flooring have been designed to make installation as easy as possible, there’s a lot of detailed work that goes into laying a floor correctly. Your perfect floor begins with a level sub-base and the right underlay, and it finishes with faultless corners and room edges that give a professional look and feel you’ll see and love for years to come.

What are the best conservatory roof options?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/conservatory-roof-options/,Conservatory,"What are the best conservatory roof options?

In This Blog: Conservatory roof options Glass conservatory roofs vs polycarbonate roofs Benefits of replacing a conservatory roof with a solid roof What’s the best conservatory roof insulation? What’s the best conservatory roof replacement? FAQs New building regulations, due to come into force in June 2022, are encouraging many homeowners to consider the best conservatory roof options.
Why? Because the new rules seek to cut carbon emissions from new homes by 30% by improving energy efficiency, and  conservatories play a big role in this .
Read on to see which roof is best for you and how to avoid the common pitfalls of not getting it right. Conservatory roof options If your home has a conservatory, you’ll know all too well how cold it can be in winter and how stifling it can be during the summer. Often, the reason for this is the conservatory roof, which can leak up to a quarter of the room’s heat.
In this post, we’ll look at the best  conservatory roof options  out there including glass, polycarbonate, and tiles, so you can decide which option suits your needs and your budget. Glass conservatory roofs vs polycarbonate roofs Glass and polycarbonate roofs both have their pros and cons, with the biggest difference being the cost. Let’s take a look:
A glass roof will retain more heat than a polycarbonate roof, which means the conservatory will be warmer when the outside temperature drops.
Glass also has a better energy efficiency rating than polycarbonate, making it a better choice from an environmental standpoint.
In terms of energy bills, you’ll spend less on heating a conservatory with a glass roof vs a polycarbonate roof.
A glass roof is longer-lasting and will stand up to the elements much better than polycarbonate – it’s less likely to be damaged or scratched.
It’s possible to have tinted or self-cleaning glass
Both options will allow plenty of light to enter the room, but polycarbonate is often opaque, so you won’t have the same views as with a glass roof.
While a polycarbonate conservatory roof is arguably not as aesthetically pleasing as a glass roof, it is the most affordable option.
Another factor to consider is noise. If you have a polycarbonate conservatory roof, you’ll clearly hear the pitter-patter of rain when the heavens open.
You can expect glass or polycarbonate roofs to last around 15-20 years.
How much does a glass conservatory roof cost vs polycarbonate?
The cost of a new glass or polycarbonate roof for a conservatory depends on its size.
For a lean-to-conservatory (3,000mm x 3,500mm) prices start at around 
£3,200
. This compares to 
£2,150
 for polycarbonate.
For a conservatory sized 4,000mm x 4,000mm, prices average around 
£5,000
. Polycarbonate averages around 
£4,000
.
Check out our post on the  price of conservatory roof replacement  for more information.

Find conservatory roof specialists near you  Benefits of replacing a conservatory roof with a solid roof Another conservatory roofing option that is growing in popularity is a solid, tiled roof, sometimes with the addition of skylights for increased ventilation and natural light.
The benefits of a tiled conservatory roof include:
A warmer conservatory.
A room that feels more like a natural part of the home – a proper extension.
Increased shade in summer, when a conservatory can often be too hot to enjoy.
Low maintenance and very long-lasting (50 years+).
A note of caution, though, you will need to make sure your existing conservatory structure can take the weight of a solid roof. The same can be said if you’re switching to a glass roof. Of course, the best way to be certain of this is to use an  experienced roofing specialist .
Replacing the roof on a conservatory does not normally need planning permission, however, you may still need building regulations approval. A quick call to your  local planning authority  will clarify whether this is needed so you can budget accordingly.
How much does a tiled conservatory roof cost?
It’ll set you back around 
£4,000
 to add a tiled roof to a conservatory sized 4,000mm x 4,000mm, or 
up to £6,000
 for a larger roof. These are ballpark figures to help to weigh up which option is best suited to your budget.

Find conservatory roof specialists near you  What’s the best conservatory roof insulation? Nowadays, with advances in materials, some of the best conservatory roof insulation comes in the form of uPVC cladding or panels that contain an insulated and ventilated core.
Benefits include:
Incredible insulation, creating a more temperate room, year-round.
Greater energy efficiency.
No glare, therefore protecting your floors, furniture, and wall hangings from sun-bleaching. What’s the best conservatory roof replacement? There are a number of conservatory roof replacement options out there, but which is best for you?
If budget is the main factor driving your decision-making, polycarbonate is a good option. It’s cheaper than glass or tiles and offers good security as it’s hard to break.
It’s not as good as glass in terms of insulation, but this can be improved with solar inserts for polycarbonate roofing.
Glass has a very pleasing aesthetic, and a full glass roof allows you to gaze up at the clouds or the stars from the comfort of indoors. It is more expensive than polycarbonate, but it’s durable and will make your home more energy-efficient.
A solid, tiled conservatory roof is the most expensive option, but it will make the room feel more like a natural part of your home with an enclosed roof. So if you’re looking to extend your downstairs living space, putting a tiled roof on your conservatory could create this option for you. Switching to a tiled roof may require  building regulations  approval, and it must also be considered whether your conservatory structure and foundations can support the additional weight.
Before deciding on the best conservatory roof option for your home, consider how you want to use the space and how much you are able to spend to help weigh up the options. To speak with an experienced conservatory specialist in your area, use our search function below. FAQs Do you need planning permission to change the conservatory roof?
If you add a solid or tiled roof to your conservatory, it may change the classification of the space from a temporary to a permanent extension. If this is the case, you will need to meet building regulations approval. Contact your local planning authority to check before you commence work.

The best ways to finance and budget for home improvements,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/finance-home-improvements/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","The best ways to finance and budget for home improvements

In This Blog: Savings Loans (secured or unsecured) Credit cards Home improvement mortgages Borrowing from a friend or family member Budgeting for home improvements Ready to transform your home? So, you’re exploring the prospect of renovating your home? What an exciting journey you’re about to get started with!
Home renovation is a fantastic way to give your home a new lease of life and to fall in love with your home all over again.
Let’s be honest, home
 renovations
 can cost a pretty penny, particularly conversions and extensions. So before finalising your ideas, what are the ways other people decide to finance their home improvements?
Well, there are many financing options for home improvements. The ways that people decide to pay for renovations include: Savings Loans Credit cards Home improvement mortgages Savings Many people decide to save up enough money to pay for their home improvement projects before starting the work. This gives them instant access to funds right from the get-go.
For many people, using savings means that you would need to save up enough money so that it could delay your project rather than start right away.
On the other hand, using savings means you avoid paying interest rates that come with different types of financing. Loans (secured or unsecured) When it comes to finding the right solution for your home improvement loan, we understand that people have varying financial positions. That’s why we always recommend seeking professional advice to explore the right option for you and your finances.
There are two different types of home improvement loan options for people to choose from – unsecured and secured:
Unsecured loans
These are personal loans that don’t require collateral.
Most unsecured loans are designed for anyone looking to borrow between £1,000 and £25,000.
Generally, you’ll need good credit to take out an unsecured loan.
Secured loans
Often referred to as homeowner loans.
Secured loans are usually secured against your home or another asset.
They can be taken out for higher amounts than unsecured loans.
Remember, the terms and rates for these types of loans will vary due to your personal circumstances.
Did you know this is one area that Checkatrade can help you?
 We work alongside our partner  Betterborrow  to offer home improvement finance. *Terms and conditions apply.

 Terms and conditions apply*
 Get a quick quote Credit cards Another way people finance home improvements is by using a credit card.
This can give you quick access to funding, especially if you use an existing credit card. Credit card interest rates vary between lenders and your circumstances, so do make sure to check these.
The terms of your credit card may mean that this is one of the more expensive options. Home improvement mortgages Borrowing on your mortgage for home improvements is an option that people choose, but there may be time limits and conditions set by your mortgage provider.
Similar to a loan, a home improvement mortgage involves borrowing extra funds to renovate your home. The debt is added to your current mortgage. It can free up funds to cover any necessary renovations or alterations to your home.
The process of signing up for a home improvement mortgage can be complicated. It may require detailed research and professional advice. This may be a more difficult and complex option that will require additional paperwork and take longer to complete. Re-mortgaging  is one option, but the amount you can borrow will depend on your credit rating, how much equity is available in your home, and the amount your renovations will increase the value of your home.
To learn more, check out our  home improvement mortgage guide .
Warning:
 Missing payments on your mortgage could result in you losing your home. Borrowing from a friend or family member Another option that people choose to fund their home renovations is to borrow money from a friend or family member. This option does bring its own set of challenges.
Borrowing from others can cause disputes that rapidly escalate into extremely emotional situations that can be hard to resolve.
Putting the loan and repayment terms in writing works well for many people. And anyone who chooses this option may also agree to pay interest on top of the total amount borrowed. Putting arrangements in place that covers what will happen if you’re unable to make payments is also something many people decide to include in their written agreement.
As with other financing options, we recommend you seek professional advice before you commit to anything. Budgeting for home improvements Once you’re sure renovating your home is the right choice for you, you’ll need to create a budget.
Budgeting for your home improvements may be intimidating, but using the below tips can save you a lot of wasted time and energy:
Decide what areas of your home need to be renovated.
Sit down with your tradesperson/people and, if necessary, your architect. You can then discuss your requirements and come up with a rough budget for the alterations.
Break down the different costs for each stage of your renovations. We’d recommend planning every part in detail.
It’s also worth contacting a few professionals to get multiple quotes and a fair price for the labour.
One of the biggest mistakes homeowners make when planning their home improvement finances is to get carried away with expensive finishing touches on the job. This can quickly burn through your carefully planned out budget. Try to decide everything upfront.
Think about working with your contractor to plan how long your project will take. This means you can set payment amounts and dates. This will make sure you’re prepared for your financial commitments.
Finally, don’t overextend yourself financially and enjoy the amazing project! Ready to transform your home? After you’ve got a good idea of what you want to do, the first step is to start looking for the best tradespeople to carry out the work. We can help you with that.
At Checkatrade, we know inviting a stranger into your home can be daunting, but our members all pass 12 thorough checks to give you peace of mind. You can be sure that you’re hiring a trustworthy, experienced tradesperson every time.

In This Blog: Signs of a leaking chimney Why is my chimney leaking water? What to do if your chimney leaks What you need to know about chimney flashing repair How to fix a chimney leak How much does it cost to repair a chimney leak? Key takeaways FAQs A chimney leak is a serious issue that should not be ignored.
If water is leaking through the chimney, the structural integrity of the chimney is being threatened, and it’s crucial you act without delay. Signs of a leaking chimney Some of the telltale signs of a leaking chimney include:
Water or condensation inside the fireplace
The sound of dripping water in the chimney
Moisture, leaks, or water staining on the walls or ceilings around the chimney
Musty odours coming from the fireplace, especially after it rains
Cracks to the interior or exterior masonry Why is my chimney leaking water? There could be a number of reasons why your chimney is leaking water, which is why it’s important to get it properly  inspected by a chimney repair specialist .
Some of the most common reasons for a chimney leaking water are:
Chimney flashing
Chimney flashing is the material around the base of the chimney stack, where it joins the roof.
If the flashing becomes damaged or has deteriorated, the seal will no longer be watertight and water will be able to penetrate through.
Chimney flaunching
Chimney flaunching is the top layer of the chimney stack, usually a mortar covering, that holds the chimney pots in place and stops rain and snow from getting into the chimney.
If the flaunching is cracked or broken, it won’t be able to protect your chimney stack as it should. Cracks can often be repaired before they become more of a problem. However, if ignored, parts of the flaunching can break off, and it may need to be completely rebuilt.
Chimney stack
The chimney stack is constantly exposed to the elements, and as such, it’s inevitable that over time, cracks can appear in the brickwork. If this occurs, water will be able to penetrate the chimney stack, causing a leak.
Chimney pointing
Chimney pointing is the mortar joints, in between the bricks of the chimney stack. Over time, this will weather and deteriorate, making it susceptible to leaks if it’s not renewed.
Chimney cap
A chimney cap may not have been installed when your chimney was constructed, but it’s a vital part of the chimney to prevent rainwater from entering. What to do if your chimney leaks As a leaking chimney stack can create significant damage to your home, it’s advisable to get your chimney leak repair booked in sooner rather than later.
Use our  request a quote  feature to receive quotes from certified chimney repair specialists in your area. You can also use our search function below to find reputable tradespeople that your neighbours have used and would recommend.

Find chimney experts your neighbours recommend  What you need to know about chimney flashing repair The thing to understand about chimney flashing is that it covers the gap between the roof tiles and the chimney stack. It must be installed expertly for a watertight seal to be created, preventing water from leaking in through the chimney.
When looking to have your lead flashing repaired or replaced, ask whether your tradesperson has a lead workers’ certificate, i.e. that they have been trained in this specialist skill.
A specialist will also be able to advise whether the existing flashing can be repaired, or whether it must be completely replaced. How to fix a chimney leak It goes without saying that working up on the roof is very dangerous.
In addition, unless the cause of the leak is obvious, e.g. a missing chimney cap, you’ll need a chimney inspection to uncover the cause of the leak.
A chimney repair specialist will have the necessary equipment to carry out this work safely and is trained to carry out any repairs to a professional standard. And let’s face it, if water is leaking through your chimney and into your home, you’ll not want anything short of that.

Find chimney experts your neighbours recommend  How much does it cost to repair a chimney leak? A chimney leak can be caused by a number of different issues, therefore it depends on what’s causing the leak as to how much it’ll cost to fix.

£500 – £1,000
 to have it repointed, depending on the extent of the work.
Chimney flashing normally costs in the region of 
£300 – £400
 to replace, depending on the scale of the job. Key takeaways Common reasons for a leaking chimney include a missing chimney cap, damaged flashing, cracks in the brickwork or the flaunching, or deterioration of the pointing.
Water penetrating your chimney can cause water damage and staining to internal walls and ceilings and threaten the structural integrity of your chimney.

Planning your kitchen revamp,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/kitchen-revamp/,Kitchen,"Planning your kitchen revamp

In This Blog: How to revamp your kitchen Kitchen revamp on a budget Kitchen revamp cost Whether you’re looking to revamp your old kitchen or completely transform it, our guide has everything you need to know about how to make redecorating as stress-free as possible.
Over time, your home will naturally suffer from wear and tear, especially in the rooms you use most often. As a result, there may be areas you want to focus on first, such as your floors or cabinets. Sometimes, changing these elements is enough to revamp your entire kitchen; however, if you’re bored with your design and want to refresh your decor, there are several things you can do.
This guide is going to go through how to plan your kitchen revamp step by step. Check out our  kitchen ideas  if you’re in need of some design inspiration. How to revamp your kitchen Planning is key when it comes to remodelling, redecorating, or  renovating your kitchen . This helps you gain a clear understanding of what’s available on your budget, the expected timeframes for each piece of work, and the likely finished results.
Step one: Decide on your decor
Whether you’re using a kitchen designer or envisioning your finished results yourself, it pays to know what kind of style you’re looking for. This helps you relay this information to any tradespeople you hire and also helps you narrow down search results. For example, searching for marble worktops, art-deco faucets or victorian floor tiles will reveal more relevant results.
Read our blog:  Cheap kitchen makeover ideas  for more inspiration. 
Step two: Create an ergonomic layout
Intuitive kitchens are worth planning. For example, trying to find a mug miles from where you keep your kettle or trekking to the utensil drawer every time you forget your garlic crusher isn’t ideal. That’s why planning your layout and making sure your workspace, storage units, and walkways all work cohesively.
Step three: Measure the area
Although a designer and/or builder will make sure everything you want fits in your kitchen, it’s still worth creating a rough floorplan. This can include where extra power sockets are needed, where the dog bed might go, any  island or peninsula  you want, and whether any extra storage is required.
Step four: Finalise your budget
Once you’ve decided on the design of your kitchen, it’s time to work out what materials and specifications you can afford. Include extra costs such as labour and any accidental damage. Once you’ve put together a list with items and costs, use this as a final guide for your kitchen design.
Step five: Hire your team and buy your materials
There are various tradespeople it’s worth hiring when it comes to revamping your kitchen. These include a  plumber ,  electrician ,  handyman ,  builder ,  designer , and  carpenter . When you  hire a Checkatrade professional , you can be safe in the knowledge that they have gone through 12 checks before becoming a member, are reviewed by previous customers and then checked again by us to make sure the reviews are real.
Step six: Let the revamp commence
Now all that’s left to do is sit back and see your planning expertise pay off. Be sure to visit the site and check for any snagging issues, such as missing or damaged items. Make a note of these so they can be fixed at a later date. Most renovations will take up to eight weeks. However, for smaller-scale revamps, expect a shorter project completion timeframe.
For more guidance on revamping your kitchen, read our  8 tips on how to plan your new kitchen  blog.

Hire kitchen experts your neighbours recommend  Kitchen revamp on a budget With the costs of material, labour, and energy prices increasing, revamping your kitchen might be the last thing on your mind. However, there are many ways to breathe new life into the hub of your home on a budget.
Revamp kitchen worktops
For worn, scratched, old, or dated worktops, replacing them can transform your kitchen. For those on a budget, replacing your worktops with laminate can cost as little as 
£500
 per unit on average, rising to 
£2,000
 for granite or quartz for an extra wow factor. Check out our  replacing kitchen worktops cost guide  for more information.
Alternatively, if you’re looking to complete this job yourself, our  how to fit cheap kitchen worktops  guide has everything you need to know about the DIY method.
Revamp kitchen cupboards
Keeping your kitchen fresh and clutter-free stops your kitchen from becoming dated. Our  kitchen storage ideas  blog has everything you need to make the most of your space.
Another way to add style and storage is to install a  kitchen island . However, if you’re on a budget and want to give this a go yourself, check out our  how to make a kitchen island  guide.
Revamp kitchen cabinets
Over time, cabinets become worn, dented, scratched, and otherwise dated. However, a great way to give them another lease of life is to  vinyl wrap them . This can set you back an average of 
£65
 per door or 
£5,000
 for 10 doors including labour. However, compared to an entire kitchen revamp, it’s a great way to give your cabinet a makeover and your entire kitchen an overall lift.
If you don’t like the idea of vinyl wrap, another option is to spray them. Read our  how to spray paint kitchen cabinets  guide for more information about this budget-friendly alternative.
Revamp kitchen tiles
Broken, cracked or mouldy kitchen tiles are unsightly and date your kitchen. Whether they’re wall or floor tiles, they can make or break your kitchen aesthetic. If your tiles are broken or cracked, it’s worth  installing some new ones , which will set you back around 
£100 per m² 
(including materials and labour). However, if your tiles are dirty or mouldy, they might just need a little TLC. Read our  how-to regrout tiles  guide to give your kitchen its sparkle back.
For some first-rate decorating inspiration, check out our  kitchen tile ideas .
Revamp dining tables and lighting
Sometimes re-accessorising or upcycling is all it takes to transform a space. Your kitchen is no exception. Consider replacing your dining table or sanding it down and giving it a fresh lick of paint. Alternatively, install under cabinet strip lights for a warm aesthetic or dome lights for a contemporary injection. Our  kitchen lighting ideas  have plenty of designs to choose from. Kitchen revamp cost Depending on the specifications, your requirements, and the number of materials required, a  complete kitchen revamp  can cost you between 
£12,000
 on the budget end and 
£35,000
 on the high-end (including labour). However, there are ways to spruce up your space without spending a small fortune, so it’s always worth shopping around for the best deals. That said, we do advise using one of our trusted tradespeople. Using a professional saves you incurring extra costs further down the line due to poor workmanship.

Notify your landlord (if relevant)
Find and  book your removals  company
Order moving boxes, bubble wrap, tissue paper, and packing tape
Sell old furniture and buy new
Book off any time you need from work Hire a cleaning firm  to do a deep clean of your property

Hire the removers your neighbours recommend  Things to do before moving house So, now you’ve got the basics sorted, what are the essentials when it comes to the physical act of moving house? Use the checklist below to get sorted: Hire a moving firm  for the date you’re leaving and provide them with instructions and moving directions.
Start packing as soon as you can. Begin with items you don’t need on a day to day basis, such as spare bedding or books.
Label your boxes and make sure you wrap any fragile items with tissue paper or bubble wrap.
Disassemble your furniture to make it easier to load into the moving van.
Be sure to defrost the freezers, disconnect the dishwashers, and give the property a  deep clean .
Fill any holes from pictures or shelves and fill them in with something like Polyfilla, or get a  handyperson  in to do this for you.
Take meter readings and let your utility suppliers know what date you’ll be moving.
Pack your important documents and items so you don’t lose them during the move. These include passports, bills, birth certificates, medications, phone numbers, chargers, toolboxes, and valuables.
Use or throw out any perishables and pack longer-life items so they don’t spill or spoil.
Register your new house for council tax.
Consider an inventory so you don’t lose track of your items.
Take photos of all your belongings in case anything goes missing.
Change your addresses with all your providers, including your bank, credit card/s, investments, loyalty card, pension schemes, the DVLA, insurance providers, GP surgery, broadband, and mobile.

Hire the removers your neighbours recommend  Moving into a new house checklist Now you’re in your new home, there are several things to get settled before you start unpacking. Here’s a handy to-do list for moving house:
Make sure you’ve paid any bills and set up new ones.
Learn where everything is in your new home, such as your stopcock, gas and electricity meter, thermostat, and fuse boxes.
Test your utilities, such as your water, heating, and washing machine to make sure they’re all in good working order.
Find out when the bins need to be taken out.
Unpack the essentials first, such as your kettle, mugs, cleaning products, loo roll, bedding, and TV/radio.
Unpack room by room, starting with the kitchen so you can make a cup of tea and have a snack whilst you unpack.
While you still have people helping you move, utilise them where possible, such as setting up the fridge or building furniture.
Consider your use of storage, including  smart options to maximise space  and intuitive unpacking methods to create a holistic or ergonomic space. (For example, how far away your mugs are from the kettle!)
Finally, take a look at our  new home job checklist  to price up any work that may need doing.
Once you’re in, it’s time to find your local takeaway and order a well-deserved treat for all your hard work.

Why is my radiator cold?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/why-is-my-radiator-cold/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Why is my radiator cold?

In This Blog: Why is my radiator cold at the top? Why is my radiator cold at the bottom? How to fix a radiator that’s not heating FAQs Key takeaways If your central heating is switched on but you’re not feeling the full benefit because your radiator feels cold to the touch, then not only are you wasting money on ineffective heating, but you’re cold too!
The good news is, there’s often a very simple fix, which you can do yourself. Read on and you’ll soon be feeling warm and toasty all over. Why is my radiator cold at the top? If your radiator is hot at the bottom, but cold at the top, it’s likely you have air trapped in the top of the radiator.
Fortunately, this is a relatively simple fix that you can do usually do yourself.
To remove the air trapped at the top of a radiator, and allow the heat to disperse evenly, you’ll need to  bleed the radiator .
How to bleed a radiator
First, turn off the central heating system.
Next, locate the bleed valve on the top or side of the radiator.
Use a radiator key or a flat head screwdriver to loosen the bleed valve.
Air will begin to escape from the bleed valve and you’ll hear a hissing sound.
When the hissing sound stops, you’ll get a little water trickling out. This is when it’s time to tighten the bleed valve back up.
Turn the central heating system back on.
Your radiator should now heat evenly.

Find a plumber your neighbours recommend  Why is my radiator cold at the bottom? If your radiator is not heating fully, i.e. your radiator is hot at the top and cold at the bottom, it could be due to sludge, debris, rust, dirt, and even limescale.
Debris accumulating in the bottom of the radiator over time, restricts the flow of hot water to the whole radiator, meaning the bottom of the radiator is not getting hot.
The debris is normally small bits of rusted metal that have flaked off from the inside of the system. The metal and water mix, corrode and settle in the bottom of the radiator. Limescale can also contribute to this, especially if you live in a hard water area.
How to remove sludge from a radiator
The best way to clear out the sludge in a radiator is with a power flush.
If you have the skills, you can remove the radiator from the pipework, take it outside and flush it through with a garden hose.
However, most people opt to  call in a qualified plumber for this job . You can expect to pay around 
£50 per hour

Find a plumber your neighbours recommend  FAQs What does it mean if my radiator is cold?
If the radiator is cold it is likely there is either air trapped at the top, or debris sitting at the bottom.
What to do if a radiator is cold
To fix a cold radiator you will either need to bleed it or power flush it, depending on the cause of the problem. Bleeding the radiator will get rid of trapped air (indicated by the rad feeling cold at the top). A power flush is needed to remove debris (indicated by the rad feeling cold at the bottom). To do this, you’ll need to remove the radiator, take it outside and flush it through with a hose.
What happens if you bleed a radiator with the heating on?
If you bleed a radiator with the heating on, you risk boiling hot water spilling out of the radiator and onto you. It’s recommended to turn your central heating system off before bleeding a radiator.
Should a radiator be hot all over?
Heat rises, so it’s natural for the radiator to feel a little warmer at the top than at the bottom. However, with your central heating system switched on, no part of the radiator should feel completely cold. Key takeaways If you have a problem with one radiator not heating properly, it could be due to trapped air or a build-up of sludge.
Trapped air is normally indicated by a radiator that’s hot at the bottom and cold at the top.
Conversely, if the radiator is not heating evenly due to debris, it’ll likely feel hot at the top and cold at the bottom.
You can relieve trapped air by bleeding the radiator. Power flushing the radiator will clear any debris inside.
There can sometimes be other reasons why your radiator is cold, including a stuck valve.
If multiple radiators are cold, this could be due to balancing, the boiler or heat pump, or water pressure.

Preventing mould on walls,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/preventing-mould-walls/,"Bathroom, Kitchen","Preventing mould on walls

In This Blog: Assess your mouldy wall before cleaning Tools required to clean mouldy walls How to clean mould off walls Cost to professionally remove mould FAQs Many homes may face the problem of mould growth on walls, often through no fault of those living in the property. Mould can be caused by hidden water ingress, room humidity or a lack of sufficient airflow around a room. In this article, we’ll look at causes of mould, ways to remove mould from your walls and how to prevent it from coming back. Assess your mouldy wall before cleaning If you have mould growing on your wall, the temptation is to get rid of it as soon as possible. This is understandable, as it’s unsightly and unhealthy, but before removing mould from your wall it’s advisable to try and understand why it’s there in the first place.
Mould loves damp, humid conditions, which our airtight and overheated homes provide in abundance. If you have mould growing in your property, it will be because something is creating this ideal environment. It could be condensation from drying clothes, a water leak, water ingress from the roof, rising damp or a lack of suitable ventilation.
Finding the cause of your mould
Getting a  mould prevention exper t in is the best course of action, but if you want to know how to stop mould on walls yourself, there are steps you can take to identify the problem and prevent it from happening again.
Firstly, you should feel around the mouldy patch. Is it damp to the touch? Is there visible water on the wall? Is mould growing in an area with little airflow?
Answering these questions will give you clues as to what’s supporting the growth of mould.
If the wall is damp
If the wall is damp to the touch, it may be a sign of water ingress behind the plaster. In this situation, you may need to get a plumber or roofer in to check for leaks.
If the wall is dry
If the wall is dry, then it could be humid room conditions that are supporting mould growth. In this case, you can try opening vents on your windows, opening windows more regularly and investing in a dehumidifier with a built-in moisture meter.
With the cause identified, you can clean the mould off yourself. To save time and have peace of mind that it’s cleaned properly, we recommend getting quotes from  trusted local specialists .

Find mould removal experts your neighbours recommend  Tools required to clean mouldy walls If you’re going to clean mould off your walls yourself, then you’ll need the right materials for the job. This way you can be sure you’ll complete the task efficiently and effectively the first time around. Here’s what you’ll need:
Bleach
Water
Rubber gloves, goggles, face mask and a full-body PPE suit
Spray bottle (optional)
Damp soft cloth
Dry soft cloth How to clean mould off walls Soapy water is great for cleaning dishes, but it’s not strong enough to clean off mould on walls. You’ll need to use a bleach and water mixture to kill and remove the spores. Be aware that in the process of removing the mould, you will more than likely rub some of the paint off the wall behind, so be prepared to repaint the area cleaned.
Protect yourself – Put on your gloves, goggles, face mask, and PPE suit to protect your clothes from gathering spores.
Prepare the cleaning mix – Mix one part bleach to four parts water in a suitable container, judge the total amount of solution needed by the size of the mouldy patch.
Scrub – Using your damp cloth gently scrub and wipe away mould.
Dry – Mould loves moisture, so be sure to dry the area well with a soft cloth after cleaning. Cost to professionally remove mould Cleaning mould is not a long-term solution, and you really need to tackle the cause of the mould to make sure it doesn’t come back. Getting a professional to come and take a look is the best way to get rid of it and stop it from coming back.
Professional mould removal costs on average, 
£225 
per job, or 
£7.93 – £19.84 per square foot
.
If you have a particularly bad case of mould across your entire property, then mould removal costs will be higher. This could cost between 
£800 – £1,000 
to get sorted. For more on prices, check out our  mould removal cost guide .

Find mould removal experts your neighbours recommend  FAQs How do I get rid of black mould on walls?
Black mould, or Stachybotrys Chartarum, is a particularly nasty form of mould and it should be dealt with very carefully as soon as discovered. It’s important not to touch or move this toxic form of mould as you may release millions of harmful spores into the air. For this reason, the best way to  remove black mould  is to  hire a professional  to do it safely.
What causes mould on walls?
Mould is a living thing, and all living things need water to exist. Mould growth is caused by a constant supply of moisture which is accelerated by humidity and a lack of ventilation. This is why mould is most common in bathrooms, where there is a constant supply of water, water vapour and heat.
How do I stop mould coming back?
While anti-mould paint will claim to stop mould coming back, it won’t solve the problem and mould will persist. To stop mould from coming back after cleaning it you need to deal with the cause of the growth. This will be because of excess moisture due to a leak, condensation, rising damp or poor ventilation. Remove the moisture supply and you’ll stop mould coming back.
How do I get rid of mould on walls permanently?
As detailed above, permanently getting rid of mould is all about removing the conditions that it thrives in. This usually means preventing moisture build-up, so fixing a leaky pipe or a leaky roof, preventing condensation from drying clothes or dealing with rising damp in basement and ground floor rooms.

What to do if you have a leaking roof?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/leaking-roof-repair/,Roof,"What to do if you have a leaking roof?

In This Blog: What causes a leaking roof? What to do when you find a leaking roof? How to detect a roof leak How to find a roof leak on a flat roof How to spot a leaking conservatory roof How to fix a leaking roof Roof leak repair costs by a professional Have you discovered a leaking roof and are now worried about what to do and how to fix it?
In this guide, we cover what to do when you discover a roof leak, what could have caused it, and how to fix a leaking roof. What causes a leaking roof? A leaking roof can be caused by age and general wear and tear, as tiles come loose, or roofing felt gets damaged. Sometimes the worst happens, and your roof can leak due to damage from bad weather such as storm damage or a falling tree. What to do when you find a leaking roof? If you find yourself facing a leaking roof, what are the important things to do?
Move anything you can out of the way of the leak. A leaking roof is bad enough, so move any possessions or furniture out of the way of the leak.
Contain the water. If you can, try to collect the water in buckets to reduce the damage to the surrounding area of your home.
Take photo’s in case you need them for an insurance claim.
If your roof has been damaged severely and it makes your home uninhabitable, or the structure is exposed to the elements, then this is classed as an emergency situation and you should contact a roofing expert immediately.

Find roofers your neighbours recommend  How to detect a roof leak The first step in resolving a leaking roof is knowing how to find a roof leak. The main things to look out for are whether you can see signs of a leak internally.
Roof leak detection is like being a detective
 – check your ceilings and walls for signs of water or watermarks and stains, as well as checking for damp patches on the floor.
Whether or not you find any clues in the rooms of your home, if you’re trying to detect a roof leak it’s also important to get up in your loft or roof space. 
Signs of a leaking roof include damp timbers and a strong musty smell.
Don’t forget to take a torch with you and a pencil or piece of chalk
. If you do detect the signs of a leaking roof, circle the area and take measurements from key marker points such as chimney stacks or vents so you can pinpoint the leak from the outside.
A good time for detecting a roof leak is after some consistent rainfall, as it will be easier to see the signs of whether your roof leaks in heavy rain. On a rainy day or after heavy rainfall you may see water coming in or dripping which will help you to pinpoint the leak.
Other ways to detect a roof leak are to conduct a water test with a hose pipe. This is best done after a dry weather spell. By directing water onto your roof with a hosepipe and then checking inside your roof space, you should be able to locate any roof leaks.
Also head outside to see if tiles are missing from the outside
 (top of your roof riles), or if the roof surface is torn or damaged, or covered in moss. 
Do not attempt to climb onto your roof to inspect it
. This should only be done by a professional with the right safety equipment.

Find roofers your neighbours recommend  How to find a roof leak on a flat roof Finding a leak on a flat roof can be harder as the water can travel in all directions, making it harder to know where the leak is coming from. Inside your home, look for dark brown damp patches.
Externally, look for signs of sagging, dipping or water pooling, as well as rings of debris and dirt. All of these signs are good indicators that there may be a leak.
The best time to find a leak in a flat roof is when the weather and therefore the roof is dry for a couple of days. You will need to be able to inspect your flat roof and as above, conduct a water test using a hosepipe. You might need to wait a while to see if and where water appears as it makes its way through all the layers of your flat roof.
Again, do not attempt to climb onto your flat roof as this can be dangerous. If it is difficult to access or inspect your flat roof then contact a professional.

Find roofers your neighbours recommend  How to spot a leaking conservatory roof Conservatories are battered by the elements and over time can be prone to leaks due to age and wear and tear. If you think you have a leaking conservatory roof, look in the corners and where the roof panels join as these are common areas for a conservatory roof leak.
If your conservatory roof is leaking where it joins to the house, this indicates that there could be an issue with the flashing. Flashing acts as a bridge between your home and your conservatory and offers a watertight seal, so inspect it for any visible signs of damage.
Before attempting any DIY fixes, find out if your conservatory is still under warranty, and if it is contact the installer. If your leaking conservatory roof has been caused by sudden damage then you may be covered by your home insurance, so check your policy.
It’s important to fix a roof leak ASAP, as long-term small leaks can cause damp and more serious issues that are expensive to repair, as well as affecting your health. How to fix a leaking roof If there is an active leak try to divert the water and seal any gaps. Draw a circle around the area to mark the original leak location and size. If the leak is large, then call a professional roofer as soon as possible.
To fix a leaking roof from the inside:
Use a bucket to collect any water.
Apply a liberal amount of roof patch to the leaking area and use a scraper to cover the area in an even coat.
Allow to dry, and apply caulking around the edges and any holes.
Consider applying roof patch tar to a shingle or piece of timber to provide a barrier to water coming in.
This is only a temporary fix to stop the leak from getting worse or causing any further damage from water coming in. We would always recommend seeking advice from a professional, so they can assess the situation and make long lasting repairs.
For more advice, take a look at our guide –  What to do when you have a leaking roof .
How to repair a leaking flat roof
To repair a leaking flat roof you can use acrylic waterproofing paint on small areas as a temporary fix. If your flat roof is leaking, before applying the waterproofing paint make sure to clean away any debris from the area first to allow for the best possible seal. This is only recommended for very small leaks.
Flat roofs can be made from a variety of materials including fiberglass, rubber and felt. Fiberglass can be temporarily repaired with acrylic sealant. Rubber roofs can be patch fixed with lap sealant or self-adhesive flashing secured with rubber tape and a coating of lap sealant.
Felt roofing is the most common for a flat roof. You can seal a flat felt roof with acrylic paint if only a small area is damaged. Due to the low cost of roof felt it is usually worth replacing it than repairing it. For a more in-depth guide see our blog  How to felt a flat roof . Roof leak repair costs by a professional Now for arguably the most important part – 
how much does a roof leak repair cost?
 The total cost will vary depending on how severe the leak is.
In some cases, it may be necessary to replace a section of your roof or the whole roof if the damage is extensive and it needs to be made structurally safe.
For a typical pitched roof, roof leak repair can cost anywhere from 
£200 to fix some roof tiles to £12,000 for a complete renovation
. The cost will also increase if there is any structural damage that needs to be assessed and repaired. The emergency call out fee for a roofing expert is approximately £350.
For a conservatory roof repair, you can expect to pay anything between 
£300 to £6,000+
 depending on the issue and the size and style of your conservatory roof. The average day rate for a roofer is between £200 and £300. For more information on roof repair costs take a look at our  roof repair cost guide .
Flat roof leak repair cost
The flat roof leak repair cost will again depend on the extent of the damage. Felt roofing costs approximately £40 to £60 per square metre, plus any labour charges of approximately £250 per day. The acrylic waterproof roof paint can cost upwards of £20 depending on the quantity you need.
As mentioned, depending on the nature of the leak it may be more cost-effective to  replace the roof , so it’s always best to consult a professional for their advice.

In This Blog: Planning your summer house build Fancy going DIY with your summer house build? How to build a summer house on a budget How to lay a concrete base for a summer house How to build an insulated summer house Building a summer house in the garden is a popular choice for many UK homeowners. With summer just around the corner, it’s worth considering how you can best spruce up your back garden so you can enjoy the summer evenings in style.
Summer houses come in various shapes, designs, and styles. There are ready-made versions, DIY designs, or bespoke models worth  hiring a professional  to help you install. Keep reading for our expert guidance on building a summer house. Planning your summer house build Installing a summer house in your back garden isn’t as simple as it sounds. Before you get started, you need to plan each detail and draw up a cost analysis to make sure you’re able to carry out the works required.
Check out our  summer house ideas  and  summer house cost guide  for more information.
Note: Summer houses sit under the umbrella of ‘ permitted development ,’ which means you don’t need planning permission to build one in your garden. However, they still need to be single-story and no more than 2.5m high if less than 2m from your garden or house boundary. 
How to build a summer house step by step
Before you get started, follow these planning steps:
Use some string and stakes (or chalk) to work out the rough square footage of your summer house. Note down these measurements.
Decide whether you want a ready-made summer house, DIY or professional installation. (Go to the next section if you picked DIY).
Make sure there’s a solid and level base for your summer house to sit on – either paving slabs or concrete. In extreme slope cases, you might have to  hire a digger  to level your garden. Otherwise, you can dig the earth to level it using our ‘ how to level a garden ‘ guide.
Decide on the materials and shape of your summer house. For example, double glazing and a pitched roof will cost more. (Note: Most ready-made designs will offer these options as standard).
Consider any decorative features, such as  decking , landscaping, paint, and the house’s overall finish. Some summer houses look great with  cladding , while others look better left natural.
Once these basics are worked out, consider  hiring the following professionals  to help with the installation: 
landscaper, gardener, builder, and electrician
.

Hire summer house experts near you   Fancy going DIY with your summer house build? How to make a summer house
Unless you’re a builder or experienced DIY’er, you’ve likely chosen a pre-made summer house design. These kits are great for various reasons, including their ease of installation, pre-checked requirements (which means no planning permission issues), and relatively quick set-up.
Before you get started, make sure you’ve checked the following:
Full instructions are provided.
All the required materials have been provided (screws, wood, roof etc.).
Whether the wood is pre-cut and planed (otherwise you might have to do this yourself).
The kind of construction method required (e.g. shiplap vs. tongue and groove).
Whether there are any electrics included. You need to make sure they’re incorporated into the design so they’re not left on external surfaces.
Once these queries have been answered, it’s time to begin your installation.
Here’s how to build a summer house
Depending on how complex the installation is, you can expect your summer house installation to take up to five days. As a result, make sure you begin construction during a mild week when there’s next to no wind or rain. A professional installation will take less time as well as making sure it’s completed to a high standard, so it’s always worth considering that option.
Step one: Lay your foundations
Summer houses need a solid and firm base to rest on to ensure their longevity. That’s why it’s important to make sure they have a sturdy foundation. It also reduces the likelihood of leaks and subsidence.
One of the most popular ways to  lay a foundation  is to dig a trench and fill it with concrete. Read our  how-to lay block paving  guide to learn the basics. Alternatively, you can use ground screws (which are up to 2.5m long) to support your summer house. This option allows you to move your summer house at a later date without incurring large costs.
Top tip:
Speak to a builder or structural engineer who’ll be able to advise you on the best foundations relative to your summer house design and soil type.
Step two: Build your summerhouse
Tools required:
Screwdriver
Handsaw
Spirit level
Mallet
Hammer
Tape measure
Drill
Ladder
Another person
DIY kit and materials
Now your foundation is laid, it’s time to put together your summer house as per the instructions on your DIY kit. Before you get started, make sure you have all the parts stated in the handbook. Then, follow each step carefully, one by one.
One of the most important aspects of your summer house is the roof. You need to make sure it’s sturdy, weighted and weathertight when fitted to the foundations of the summerhouse. The same goes for the windows and doors. The foundations all need to be level with appropriate guttering to ensure run-off.
Don’t forget to read our ‘ how to build a summer house  guide for more comprehensive information.
Step three: Add the finishing touches
Not all DIY kits come painted, so it’s worth considering what finish you’d like on your summer house to make it attractive and weatherproof. This is also a good time to take measurements of the inside of your summer house so you can shop for furniture and accessories.
Why not check out our  summer house ideas  to help inspire your shopping trip? Alternatively,  hire an interior designer  to really help your summer house pop.
Step four: Maintain your summer house
Once your summer house is completed, it’s time to enjoy it. However, to make sure it lasts, make sure you know what maintenance is required. For example, how often it requires a top-up of wood treatment preservative.
Another thing you might notice is how your wooden summerhouse shifts and settles weeks or months after installation. This is perfectly normal and just requires some extra tweaking or readjusting of doors and windows. You’ll know this is the case if they stick or jam.
Most summer houses will come with a guarantee of at least 10 years. However, it’s always worth doing your part to maintain it.

Hire summer house experts near you  How to build a summer house on a budget Building a summer house on a budget begins during the planning stage. It starts when you consider the square footage, shape, and design of your house. For example, smaller designs, cheaper wood, a less extravagant roof, ground screws and a flat-packed kit will all save you money.
For professional fees, a rough estimate for a concrete building on a new concrete foundation will cost an average of 
£10,000
, including labour. Expect to pay around 
£3,000 
(including labour) for a basic timber cabin,
 £7,500
 for a pre-made kit, and up to 
£25,000 
for a custom design. How to lay a concrete base for a summer house Want to how to build a summerhouse base? Check out the following guides: How to build a base for a garden shed How to lay a concrete floor Alternatively, use ground screws to secure your summer house. How to build an insulated summer house Building and insulating a summer house is similar to building and insulating a normal property. However, it costs less due to the smaller square footage. Consider adding  double glazing  and  roof, floor, and wall insulation  to keep your summer house cosy, even in winter.

How to regrout bathroom tiles
Follow these steps to learn how to regrout bathroom floor tiles:
Place your dust sheets over anything you want to protect in your bathroom and put on your safety equipment.
Use your grout remover blade to cut away as much grout as possible. Run the blade along the edges of the tiles carefully so you don’t accidentally damage the tiles.
Take your scraper and ‘chisel’ out any leftover grout debris. Then vacuum up any dust as you go.
Finish the removal by cleaning the surfaces with a damp sponge. Leave to dry.
Take your chosen ready-made or ready-mix grout and your spreader and apply it to the chiselled out holes between your tiles.
Work in a diagonal motion to ensure there are no gaps in your application. You can also use the edge of your spreader to scrape off excess grout and re-apply it elsewhere.
Wipe off any excess with a damp cloth or sponge.
Leave the grout to set and then wipe down the tiles with a wet sponge, rinsing out the excess in your bucket.
Once the grout is set and dried, use a dry cloth to remove the powdery residue that’s inevitably been left behind.
Top tip:
Where tiles touch another surface (such as a bath), don’t grout the area. Instead, seal with a silicone sealant after your grout is dry.

How to regrout shower tiles
Follow these steps to learn how to regrout shower tile walls:
Place your dust sheets over anything you want to protect in your bathroom and put on your safety equipment.
Dig out the existing grout at a minimum of 3mm deep. (Trying to grout over old grouting will cause issues in the long term).
Use a grout rake or an oscillating tool to effectively remove old grout over a large surface area. Be careful to avoid the tiles. Any slipups could result in damage that requires repairing. Patience is key.
Mix your grout in a bucket as per the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure a smooth consistency.
Take your spreader and apply the mix to the chiselled out holes between your tiles.
Work in a diagonal motion to ensure there are no gaps in your application. You can also use the edge of your spreader to scrape off excess grout and re-apply it elsewhere.
Wipe off any excess with a damp cloth or sponge.
Leave the grout to set and then wipe down the tiles with a wet sponge, rinsing out the excess in your bucket.
Once the grout is set and dried, use a dry cloth to remove the powdery residue that’s inevitably been left behind.
Top tip:
Make sure your grout is suitable for the area you’re grouting. For example, some brands are recommended for shower rooms, and others are recommended for floors.

How to regrout kitchen tiles
Follow these steps to learn how to regrout kitchen counter tiles:
Locate the tiles your want to regrout and remove the old grout using your tool of choice (oscillating machine or grout remover blade).
Once the grout is removed, sponge down the area and wipe it clean.
Mix your chosen grout or use a ready-mix if you’re working on a smaller area (e.g. if you only want to touch up a few areas and not an entire wall).
Take your scraper and use it to re-apply grout on the areas you previously removed. Use a diagonal motion to avoid air bubbles or bumps.
Use a grout finishing tool to ensure a neat line. Gently run it across the grouting for a clean finish.
Remove the chalky film by using a damp sponge to lift the residue. Finish by buffing the tiles with a clean cloth.
How to regrout tile without removing old grout
We highly recommend removing your old grout before applying any new grout on top. Due to its porous nature, which is designed to make the space between tiles watertight, it can’t be ‘fixed’ by simply adding more grout on top. The new mixture won’t adhere to the old one, and the cracks, crumbling or other issues that made you want to add grout onto your tiles in the first place will simply transfer to your new grout.
How to regrout ceramic tile floor
Follow these steps to learn how to regrout tile floors.
Put on your safety equipment.
Use a grout removing oscillating tool to remove the old grout (vacuum as you go).
Go over the area again with the oscillating tool to carefully clean up the grout lines.
Don’t force the blade. You can remove stubborn areas manually with a grout removal blade.
Vacuum and clean the area with a damp sponge.
Mix the grout in a bucket as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Fill the grout joints using a scraper or trowel in diagonal sweeping movements.
Sponge down the grout and tiles, rinsing and cleaning as you go, and leave to dry.
After it’s dried, remove the residue with a damp sponge and buff the area with a dry cloth.

Hire grout specialists your neighbours recommend  FAQs How hard is it to regrout tiles?
Although the process is relatively simple, the margin for error is high when working with delicate tiles (particularly the ceramic variety). You will need a steady hand and lots of patience. If you’re in any way unsure, why not  hire a professional  to make sure the results are clean and long-lasting.
Is regrouting worth it?
For tiles that are still in good condition, regrouting is a great way to spruce up your walls or floors. New grout is transformative, giving a showhome finish, and it also removes any mould or mildew buildup that’s detrimental to your health.
Can you put new grout on top of old grout?
It isn’t recommended due to the porous nature of grouting. So, if you’re asking yourself, ‘do I have to remove all old grout before regrouting?’ the answer is yes. Adding new grout on damaged or mouldy old grout will just exasperate the problem.

National insurance for the self-employed explained,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/national-insurance-for-the-self-employed-explained/,Tag Not Found,"National insurance for the self-employed explained

Managing your finances is an important part of running a successful business, as is understanding how national insurance (NI) contributions apply to you when working as a tradesperson.
If you’re looking to brush up on the accounting side of your business, then read on as this guide takes you through everything you need to know about NI, including how to register self-employed national insurance and how you can stay on top of your finances in this area.
In a hurry? Scroll down to the FAQs for some quick answers.
Do self-employed pay national insurance?
Paying national insurance tax entitles you to a state pension and other unemployment benefits. Just like employers and workers, self-employed people can be required to pay national insurance contributions (NIC). However, it only applies if you make a profit of £6,515 or more per year. If this is the case, you’ll be required to pay self-employed NI until you reach the state pension age.
How much national insurance do I pay self-employed?
How much NI you pay will depend on what class you fall into. If your profits go over £6,515, you’ll have to pay a Class 2 national insurance contribution of £3.05 a week. Whereas if your profits are over £9,569, you will then have to pay Class 4 national insurance as well as Class 2.
In the instance that your profits fall into the Class 4 category, your payments can still vary depending on how much you make. The initial rate starts at 9%, but if you earn more than £50,270, the rate drops to 2%.
If you work for an employer but also have your own self-employed income on the side, you might be wondering where you stand when it comes to national insurance. In this scenario, it’s best to visit the HMRC site and find out your official employment status. It’s also worth checking out our freelancing taxes guide  here  for more helpful advice.
Voluntary national insurance
Keep in mind that if you’re self-employed and don’t pay NI, you can still choose to make voluntary payments to fill any gaps in your NI records. These would fall into the Class 3 bracket. Gaps can happen due to you:
Being unemployed and not claiming any benefits
Being employed but not earning enough to pay national insurance
Being self-employed but not making enough profit to pay national insurance
Living abroad
You can check for gaps in your records and if you’re eligible to make voluntary contributions by visiting the UK government website.
You might also choose to make voluntary contributions to get a higher state pension. Keep in mind that you’ll need to have 35 qualifying years of NI contributions to receive the full pension and a minimum of 10 years to receive a reduced pension.
If you had small profits at certain points in time while running your business, you could decide to make voluntary NI payments in this instance. Class 3 contributions can be paid at a weekly rate of £15.40.

NI is usually paid through your annual self-assessment tax return which reports your untaxed income to HMRC. This will take into account all ingoings and outgoings for your business from the past year.
You can fill out and submit your self-assessment form online through the HMRC website. It’s vital that you document your financial records on a regular basis not only to make your life easier but also so you can complete the form properly. If you’re a sole trader, you’ll need to bookkeep:
Your expenses
Invoices
Other business income from selling off assets like equipment or property
If you manage a limited company, you’ll need these plus a few extra documents including:
Your P60 – this shows the tax you paid in the past tax year
Your P11D – this is only applicable if you have employees who get certain benefits like a company car for example
Don’t forget to keep an eye on the deadlines for filing your self-assessment form. This is usually around October but it’s best to double-check so you know the exact dates. If you’re struggling to keep on top of finances, it might be a good idea to hire an accountant for help. For more information on accountancy services, read our article  here .
If you miss the deadline, you could be fined by HMRC. This is usually £100 for three months’ delay and can rise if you wait even longer, so make sure you complete your tax return on time. Bear in mind it generally takes between five days and eight weeks for HMRC to process a self-assessment, so it’s best to complete your form sooner rather than later.
FAQs
Is there any difference between limited company national insurance and sole trader national insurance? 
There is a slight difference in how NI works depending on the business structure. Sole trading means you’ll be paying Class 2 or Class 4 contributions depending on your profits. As a limited company on the other hand, you’ll have to pay the employer’s Class 1A or 1B National Insurance on salaries and staff as well. For more information on running a limited company, check out our guide  here .
What benefits do my NI contributions pay for?
NIC pay for several benefits including:
Maternity Allowance
Contribution-based/New Style Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)
Contribution-based/New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
Bereavement Benefits
Basic State Pension

Top 5 low maintenance alternatives to grass,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/top-alternatives-to-grass/,Garden,"Top 5 low maintenance alternatives to grass

In This Blog: Why consider alternatives to a grass lawn Top 5 grass lawn alternatives Grass alternatives for dogs Sustainable lawn alternatives What are the best lawn replacement plants? High-traffic lawn alternatives FAQs In this post, we’ll share some of the best alternatives to grass to help inspire your outdoor space. While a garden is almost synonymous with grass, there are plenty of other ways to design your garden without the need for a turfed lawn.
There are many reasons why people often sway towards lawn alternatives, including:
The costs of maintaining a grass lawn
The environmental impact of mowing and watering the grass
The time it takes to care for a grass lawn. Why consider alternatives to a grass lawn To maintain a lush-looking lawn, you’ll need regular lawn feed and treatment, which of course, cost money. Then there’s the cost of watering, and fuelling the lawnmower (if using a petrol mower).
To keep a lawn green and healthy, it’ll also need regular watering during dry weather. You can however rely on a water butt to reduce the dependency on the garden hose.
Finally, if your preference is a neat and tidy aesthetic, you’ll need to invest the time it takes to achieve this. Or  find a gardener to help you ! While mowing and edging aren’t necessary during the winter months, this is normally a weekly task throughout the rest of the year. Another consideration is the space needed to store your lawnmower.
So while a lush grass lawn has many plusses, the cost and time it takes to maintain it are leading many homeowners to consider the lawn alternatives available. Top 5 grass lawn alternatives There are so many lawn alternatives, it really depends on your style, budget, and the amount of time you wish to invest in maintenance, as to which option you choose.
Here are our top 5 grass replacement ideas for the garden:
Wild garden meadow
If you’re keen to invite as much wildlife as possible into your garden, this one’s for you.
A wild garden meadow is great for biodiversity, providing new habitats for pollinators and a source of food for birds and insects.
There are many ways to turn your lawn into a wild garden meadow. One of which is to plant wildflower plugs, which you can mix up with perennial grasses for year-round interest.
Prairie planting
If you enjoy ambling through the relaxed yet ordered planting akin to a National Trust garden, you’ll love this idea.
Prairie planting typically involves a mixture of grasses and flowering perennials, planted in drifts of varying proportions. This means that you can enjoy all the species you’ve planted, and – if you’re clever about it – have interest year-round.
Separate these naturalistic borders with gravel or paved pathways to wander through your wildlife haven with not a lawn in sight.

Find landscapers your neighbours recommend 
Courtyard garden
A  courtyard garden  is a great lawn alternative for a smaller outdoor space and can really create that ‘wow’ factor.
It’s possible to achieve a sleek and stylish outdoor scheme that feels like a natural extension to your home. Using pots and planters, and even wall-loving climbers, you can create a beautiful, sheltered garden to relax in.
Not sure how to get started?  Find a local landscape gardener  using our free search function.
Evergreen moss garden
One of the most appealing things about a moss garden is its evergreen nature. So all year-round your garden will have an abundance of different green hues.
This is a great option if you want more of a low-maintenance alternative to grass. You can also select a variety of moss species for added interest.
Combine a moss planting scheme with some hardscaping for an impressive outdoor space. You might also consider a pond or water feature too.
Artificial grass
For  zero maintenance , artificial grass is the best alternative to a grass lawn.
It may not have quite the same soft, underfoot feeling, but it doesn’t require the same mowing, watering, or maintenance as grass.
There are different grades of artificial grass, which is reflected in the  cost . Prices start from as little as 
£9 per m2
 for the budget option, with a premium grass costing up to 
£45 per m2
. Installation is on top, which typically costs in the region of 
£450 for a day’s labour
. Here’s more on the  cost of artificial grass .

! Grass alternatives for dogs Anyone’s who’s witnessed their dog rolling around on the lawn understands how much dogs appreciate the feel of natural grass.
Having said that, dogs also like to carve out paths by taking the same route over and over, to the point where you might notice worn-out patches on your lawn.
So what’s a good grass alternative for dogs? A happy compromise would be a landscaped garden that offers the best of both. A smaller grassed area, combined with brick or paved paths for those little paws to happily trot up and down on. Sustainable lawn alternatives Sustainable lawn alternatives offer you the opportunity to enjoy a beautiful outdoor space that is more natural than a manicured lawn, and better for the environment. Scroll up for some of our favourite ways to achieve sustainable lawn alternatives, including wildflower gardens, prairie planting, and moss gardens. What are the best lawn replacement plants? Some of the best lawn replacement plants include:
Clover
Sedum
Wildflower meadow
Creeping thyme
Corsican mint
Moss
Chamomile High-traffic lawn alternatives High-traffic lawn alternatives are appealing for the areas of the garden that are subject to fairly heavy footfall, i.e. the areas most trodden on.
When looking for a lawn alternative for these well-used parts of the garden, you’ll want to avoid something such as a Chamomile lawn, which will only tolerate occasional, light pedestrian traffic.
Instead, you could opt for hardscaping such as decking or paving, which is a popular, lower maintenance lawn alternative. FAQs What can I use instead of grass?
There are so many alternatives to grass, you are spoilt for choice. Create a wild meadow, a moss garden, a prairie planting scheme or even go for artificial turf!

Does rendering a house add value?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/does-rendering-add-value/,Living Room,"Does rendering a house add value?

In This Blog: The benefits of rendering that can add value to your home Choosing the right type of render & colour to add value to your home Rendering costs – does rendering add value to your home? The property market has seen a lot of movement in the last year. If you’re looking to sell, or simply spruce up your home, then you might be curious to know what improvements you can make to add value. 
Rendering is one option, but does rendering a house add value? Let’s take a look… The benefits of rendering that can add value to your home Rendering your home offers a few practical benefits that can add value to your property including:
Aesthetics
Damp prevention
Improve insulation and energy efficiency
One of the main factors contributing to the value of your home is its kerb appeal, so a clean and tidy finish will always be a huge benefit. A fresh coat of render can take years off the visual age of your home, which appeals to buyers and subsequently adds value and some money to the asking price.

Find plasterers your neighbours recommend 
Damp is a real problem for many homeowners. Rendering offers a watertight seal on the exterior of your home, keeping moisture out and minimising the risk of damp. Signs of damp can be offputting for potential buyers so by eliminating this risk, rendering a house could definitely add to its value.
Similarly, prospective buyers will also be conscious of the costs of the upkeep of a potential new home. In the same way as rendering protects against damp, the barrier it provides improves the insulation of your home and therefore its energy efficiency. So, does rendering a house add value? Absolutely it can, both financially for the homeowner and for potential buyers. Choosing the right type of render & colour to add value to your home As we’ve highlighted, rendering can definitely add value but it is important to consider the type of render and the choice of colours available. Choosing a finish and colour that stands out too much could do the opposite of adding value!
There are 3 types of render that are most common: Cement, Lime and Pebbledash.
Cement render
 is the most basic type of render and the most traditional. This mortar provides a smooth flat finish that is naturally grey in colour but colour pigments can be added to the mixed mortar.
The colour options for cement render are almost limitless but after exposure to the elements, these natural changes might become more obvious and have a detrimental effect on the final look. This is something to bear in mind if you are rendering your house to add value.
Lime render
 uses lime and sand to create a mortar. This type of render is more flexible than cement and so less prone to cracking but it is more expensive and takes longer to apply. Lime render is popular as it is more eco-friendly and has a natural finish that many people find attractive.
Pebble dash
 render is created by adding gravel, flint or shells to either a cement or lime mortar. This creates a rough textured look. Areas of flint pebble dash can add some prestigious character to a property, but any kind of pebble dash render doesn’t tend to age gracefully and can look messy when it becomes worn over time.
Rendering a house can certainly add value, but it is really important to consider the type and colour to make sure your property stands out for all the right reasons. For more information on render see our blog, ‘ What type of render is best? ‘ You may also be interested to learn more about  Monocouche render  or  Tyrolean render .
There are lots of options when it comes to choosing render, so for the best advice, speak to a recommended local plasterer who will be able to help you make the right decision for your property.

Find plasterers your neighbours recommend  Rendering costs – does rendering add value to your home? As we’ve covered, rendering can certainly add value to your home but depending on a number of factors, it can be a considerable investment. Overall, the cost will depend on the size of your property, the type of render and finish you prefer and whether or not there are any other costs for the project, such as scaffolding.
For more in-depth information on pricing, take a look at our  rendering cost guide .
Rendering can be an incredibly effective way to improve the overall look and appeal of your property, especially if it is older. It is also a creative way to add character and individuality.
A note of caution though, if you are rendering a house to add value, you must ensure it is in keeping with any surrounding properties. Everyone’s taste is different, so be sure to take into account the typical aesthetic of your local area and choose a finish that is sympathetic to your neighbours.
If your chosen finish objectively improves the look of your property then it is more than likely that rendering your house will add value.
Rendering is a skilled trade, and the success of the final look is very much down to the skill of the application. For this reason, rendering your entire property is definitely a job for a professional. If you’re keen to learn more about the rendering process, read our blog on  how to render a wall .

How to start a car valet business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-start-a-car-valet-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a car valet business

If you’re passionate about cars and you’ve got a great eye for detail, starting a car valeting business could be an ideal career move for you.
Both car owners and company car providers regularly have their vehicles cleaned, meaning there’s good money to be made in a well-run valet service. In fact, professional cleaning and valeting services have quickly become one of the fastest-growing industries thanks to the increased focus on hygiene and cleanliness since the onset of the pandemic.
That said, car valeting can be a difficult industry to break into without the right knowledge. This is why we’ve put together a guide on how to start a successful valet business, so you can take advantage of the demand with all the best tips and advice in mind.
In a hurry? No problem, scroll down to the FAQs section for some quick answers.
How to start a mobile car valeting business
Deciding whether to operate a mobile service or base yourself somewhere permanently will be an important decision as you start up. Choosing to go mobile gives you the freedom to reach more customers, although you will need to invest in a van and consider the fuel costs involved when working this way.
If you do go mobile, make sure you can also transport and power all of your equipment properly. Pressure washers, for example, are an essential part of an efficient valeting service, as they get all the dirt off quickly for you to apply waxes and other finishes. Make sure you can support one on the road, otherwise you might need to ask for permission to use a customer’s water and mains supply. This won’t always be possible, so it’s best to be self-sufficient.
On the other hand, car valet businesses with their own premises can build a local client base and benefit from no extra travel costs. If you choose to do this, you still might need to cover other costs like local business rates. Almost every non-domestic property will be liable to pay a fee to the council, so check how much it is in your area and factor it into your cashflow.
Car valet business plan
Next comes the essential step of drawing up a business plan. This should take the following into account:
Start-up costs
Target market
What your unique selling point will be
Types of services you’re going to offer your customers
Pay rates
Expected profit margins
Hiring colleagues
Areas of opportunity
It’s vital that you try to be as thorough as possible when estimating your start-up costs to avoid being caught off guard. The more thorough you are, the better you’ll be able to budget – if anything, it’s better to overestimate.
How to set up a car valeting business
Registration
To lay the foundations, you’ll first need to register your business with HMRC and decide on a structure. You can choose to either set up as a sole trader or limited company.
Sole trading can be easier for getting the ball rolling quickly, but keep in mind you’ll be personally responsible for any debt or losses you rack up, unlike a limited company. This is just one of the things to consider, so it’s best to weigh up the pros and cons of each before coming to a decision. You can read our comparison guide  here  for a more detailed overview.
Protecting your business
It might sound surprising but there are a few rules and regulations you should be aware of when starting up your car valeting business. These are mainly concerned with pollution and the water run-off created when servicing vehicles. It’s important to take note of your obligations, especially if you’re using any of the following:
Detergents
Oil and fuel
Suspended solids
Grease
Antifreeze
Do some  research  before beginning any practical work or you could be facing fines. For this reason, the right insurance is a must. Without it, one small mistake could see you paying back for many years to come. Here are the main types you should consider:
Tools insurance – This will cover replacement costs should your equipment be stolen, damaged or lost Public liability insurance  – Protects your business from compensation and legal fees if a customer claims you’ve damaged their car Professional indemnity insurance  – In the event you make a mistake in your work that causes the client financial loss
Research
Carrying some market research in your target area is really important. You want to make sure potential clients are nearby, making it easier to develop new and repeat business.
It’s also worth investigating what services your local competitors are offering and looking at what they’re doing well or not so well. Have a think about what unique selling points will set you apart from the crowd. This could be flexible hours or offering other add-ons with your service, such as detailing or wrapping. Car wrapping is another means of transforming customers’ cars using vinyl. Check out our blog on how to start a car wrapping business  here. Many people choose to wash or valet their cars themselves to save money, so you must make sure your business is worth whatever you charge. Remember, people will be more willing to pay for the convenience of having someone else service their vehicle, especially if they know you offer a consistent high-quality service.
Finances
Maintaining a steady cash flow will prove vital in keeping your local valet business running smoothly, so it’s best to think about how you want to reinvest your profits to grow at a steady pace.
That’s why it’s so important to keep a close eye on all your ingoing and outgoings. This way, you can have a good idea of how your business is performing and make changes where necessary.
Don’t forget to factor in taxes too. These will need to be filed on a regular basis so you can keep on top of things. If you feel a bit overwhelmed with this process, it could be helpful to hire a professional accountant. Read our article  here  for more information about that.

Brushes
Chamois
Squeegees
Pressure washer
Polishers
Soaps
Polishes
Cleaning chemicals
Vacuum cleaner
Buffing machine
For a mobile car valet business, you will also need a van with enough room to transport all of your equipment.
Car valet marking strategy
When it comes to your marketing strategy, your simplest route to finding work is by speaking to friends and family. They’ll be able to get the message out to their friends, social circles and colleagues word-of-mouth. Don’t forget your neighbours, especially if you’re thinking of going mobile. They will likely become your regulars!
After acquiring some initial business, you’ll need to consider spending some time building an online presence.  Signing up to Checkatrade  is perfect for this as you’ll be able to showcase the customer recommendations you gain to millions of monthly site users. You could also consider setting up a profile across social media platforms to expand your audience and interact with potential customers.
Local ads and flyers are also great for this type of work, so consider investing in some to hand out around areas you’re intending to work in.
Car valeting business starter kit
Your car valet business starter kit can be seen as a checklist for all the points touched upon in this guide. Here’s a quick rundown of everything you’ll need:
A solid business plan
Registration
Insurance
The right skills and equipment
Market research
Marketing strategy
Finance management
As long as you do your research, plan your costs effectively and be patient, you should start to see a return on your investments. That said, it’s always worth having some savings to fall back on and get you through the first few months.
FAQs
Can you run a car valeting business from home?
If you’re considering this route, it would be best to start off by contacting your local council and insurance provider. You should also check your title deeds on your property to make sure you have the green light to legally trade.
How much can you earn running a car valeting business?
The National Careers Service estimates the starter salary for a car valet at roughly £14,000, rising to £16,500 for a more experienced professional. But these are just ballpark figures for entry-level positions. As the owner of a successful business, you could take home far more than this, especially if you’re efficient and have a steady stream of work coming in.

With the impending gas boiler ban, homeowners want to know what will replace gas boilers in 2025. As per a 2019 government announcement, no fossil-fuel heating systems will be installed in newly built domestic properties. Consequently, people are wondering what it all means and what they should do.
Ultimately, the move comes as part of the UK government’s promise in their 
Future Homes Standard
 to create a zero-carbon country by 2050. This is to tackle the climate change crisis and create a more sustainable energy market. Boris Johnson also announced a ‘Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution,’ and due to the part our homes play in creating harmful emissions – especially those from gas boilers – the move is an overwhelmingly positive step and one worth welcoming.
‘From 2025 at the latest, no new homes should be connected to the gas grid.
They should be heated using low-carbon energy sources, have ultra-high levels of energy efficiency alongside appropriate ventilation, and be timber-framed where possible
.’ –   Climate Change Committee .
The latest from the UK government is that households can benefit from £5,000 government grants through the  Boiler Upgrade Scheme  (BUS). These will be available from April 2022. What will replace gas boilers? Despite a lot of talk about a gas boiler ban, measures such as these will be introduced gradually. It’s unlikely that homeowners will see any outright bans, especially considering 95% of UK households use a gas boiler to heat their homes. Instead, green or carbon-neutral alternatives will be installed in new builds, while replacements or upgrades will be offered to homeowners – especially to those on a low income.
So, what is the future of gas boilers? Alternatives to gas boilers Green alternatives to gas boilers (or those that don’t require fossil fuels) include: Heat pumps As they run on electricity, heat pumps (likely  air source ) will be the most common replacement for gas boilers. They work by using a chemical compound called a ‘refrigerant’ to soak up the natural heat found in the air, ground, or water source, further compressing it within the pump to increase the temperature and heat the cold water in the boiler system. (This is what heats a home’s radiators or hot taps). Electric boilers Electric  boilers  are significantly more efficient than gas boilers, which is why there will be a lot of them around by 2025. They produce zero carbon emissions, however, do cost slightly more than their gas alternatives. Solar heating systems Thermal solar panels, which heat water, or  solar PV panels , which provide electricity, are all clean and green energy alternatives that help heat your house. Biomass boilers Biomass boilers run on non-fossil fuel sources, which make them efficient alternatives to gas and electric boilers.

When will natural gas be phased out?
Knowing how long natural gas reserves will last is impossible to predict. However, based on current global consumption and known natural gas reserves, the world will likely run out in around 50 years. Air source heat pump vs. gas boiler When comparing heat pumps to gas boilers, the two technologies are worlds apart. Their only similarity is their provision of hot water and central heating to a property. Boilers produce a large amount of high-temperature heat in a short space of time and work well with radiators, whereas heat pumps produce heat slowly over a larger surface area and with smaller temperature differences. This means that they become convectors instead of radiators. As such, they work well with  underfloor heating systems .
Heat pump vs gas boiler running costs
Upgrading your boiler system and pipes requires extensive works, which means you’re looking at between 
£8,000- £16,000 
to install an air source heat pump for a new build. However, these prices increase on existing properties and can cost up to 
£28,000. 
For ground source heat pumps, it could cost are between 
£14,000 – £25,000
, although this goes up if you need a large  borehole  collector. Alternatively,  hire a digger  and dig horizontal trenches yourself. Some of these costs might be covered by the  Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive  (RHI).
On the other hand, a combi-boiler installation can cost between 
£2,000 –
£3,000,
 including the system and labour required.
When it comes to the cost of energy, heat pumps use electricity and boilers burn gas. However, as the costs of gas and electricity change, so do the calculations. To make sure your replacement boiler is efficient, you’ll need to calculate the differences. Although it might not seem efficient to replace your boiler just yet, heat pumps are the future.

Find boiler installation experts your neighbours trust  FAQs What will replace gas boilers in 2025?
Heat source pumps are being lauded as the alternative to gas boilers. Why not get ahead of the 2025 ban by  hiring a professional  to install one in your home?
Will I have to replace my gas boiler after 2025?
It’s unlikely that there will be an outright ban on gas boilers. However, to reach the UK’s carbon-neutral targets, measures must be put in place to ensure this environmental goal is achieved.
Are air source heat pumps the future?
Due to their effectiveness and green credentials, property developers will likely install air source heat pumps in every newly built home from 2025 onwards. This is to help the government achieve its target of an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030.
How are new homes heated after 2025?
New homes will run on carbon-neutral, environmentally-friendly heat pumps/networks as of 2025 to help the government meet its carbon-reduction targets by 2030.

What to do if your boiler loses pressure?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/what-to-do-boiler-loses-pressure/,Kitchen,"What to do if your boiler loses pressure?

In This Blog: Why does my boiler keep losing pressure? Common causes for boiler losing pressure Why is my combi boiler losing pressure? Why is my gas boiler losing pressure? Why is my boiler losing pressure but no leak? Do you know what to do if your boiler loses pressure? If you’re concerned that your boiler pressure keeps dropping, read on to find out the reasons why it’s dropped and what you can do. Why does my boiler keep losing pressure? You may be wondering why your boiler keeps losing pressure, but you’re probably also wondering why boiler pressure is even important in the first place?
You’ll be well aware that your boiler system contains water that gets heated up, and this water is pumped around your central heating and hot water system to keep your water and home toasty warm. The boiler pressure is important as it is the pressure that helps to keep that hot water going to where it is needed and your hot water and heating system working efficiently. If your boiler is losing pressure there can be a few common causes. Common causes for boiler losing pressure The most common causes for a boiler losing pressure are:
Leaks
Bleeding radiators
If your boiler pressure keeps dropping the culprit may be a leak somewhere in your central heating or hot water system.
When you think of a leak, you might be imagining a large-scale leak with water gushing from a pipe. Those leaks will of course cause your boiler to lose pressure, but more common is a small or ‘slow’ leak that could be the size of a pinhole. These kinds of small leaks cause a gradual loss of pressure that eventually causes your boiler to stop working properly.
To find out if you have a small leak, look for damp patches under radiators or pipework, or underneath where your boiler is located. If you check your boiler pressure regularly, you may also notice the pressure reducing over time.
Your boiler losing pressure may also be the result of bleeding your radiators. When a radiator is bled air is also released. If you have bled multiple radiators recently, then enough air may have been released during the bleeding process to cause your boiler to lose pressure.
To check your boiler pressure there is usually a pressure gauge that looks like a dial with an indicator needle. This gauge is normally towards the front or just underneath your boiler.
When the boiler is idle and your radiators are cold, you can expect the pressure to be just above 1 bar. When your radiators are hot you can expect the pressure to be at approximately 2 bar.
The normal pressure range for a boiler is between 1 to 2.5 bar, so if your boiler pressure drops below 1 bar, there is not enough pressure to keep the hot water flowing around your heating system.
Repressurising your boiler
It’s usually possible for you to repressurise your boiler following the instructions for your specific make and model. These instructions should be available in your boiler manual or can be found online.
For more information, you can also read our guide ‘ How to repressurise a boiler ‘. Why is my combi boiler losing pressure? Your combi boiler might be losing pressure if there is a problem with a part called the pressure relief valve (PRV).
If you have had a continuous flow of water running through this valve then debris or build-up may cause this valve to get blocked. As this valve is a crucial part of your boiler system, if this part fails then so will your boiler.
Check your boiler’s safety discharge pipe (usually located outside on the wall where your boiler is installed) and if this pipe is dripping or has water leaking from it, there is a good chance there is an issue with the pressure relief valve.
Your combi boiler losing pressure may also be as a result of air in the system or due to a leak as we talked about above. Check for signs of water around your pipework and radiator valves, as well worktops or kitchen cabinets which might tip you off that there is a leak.
To prevent issues like this from cropping up, it’s always recommended to get your  boiler serviced  annually by a CORGI registered heating engineer.

Find heating engineers your neighbours recommend  Why is my gas boiler losing pressure? The most common reason for a gas boiler losing pressure is a problem with a safety device or a faulty part.
The first thing to do is check your boiler’s display panel to see if there are any error codes. Check these against your boiler manual or you can look them up online.
Another thing to check is whether your boiler pilot light has gone out. If the pilot flame is out then your boiler will have stopped working. If you can’t see the blue flame or if your boiler panel indicates that the pilot light has gone out, then take a look at our blog about  what to do if your boiler pilot light has gone out .
If it’s still not clear what the problem is then it’s time to call on the help of a professional.

Find heating engineers your neighbours recommend  Why is my boiler losing pressure but no leak? If you’ve tried to be a detective and can’t find a leak but your boiler is still losing pressure, then there is either a faulty part causing the issue such as a faulty pressure gauge or pressure relief valve.
Boilers expand and contract as they heat and cool and work pretty hard, especially in winter, so there may be other internal issues inside your boiler that are the cause of the problem.
The best thing to do if your boiler pressure keeps dropping
 is to 
get in contact with a heating engineer to diagnose and  repair the problem .
If your boiler is getting old and consistently loses pressure then it might be time to invest in a replacement.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now What’s the average Tesla charger price? When you buy a Tesla, a mobile connector and NEMA 5-15 adaptor is included as standard. This allows you to plug into your standard three-prong home electrical supply to charge your vehicle. For convenience, many people choose to charge their Tesla at home, overnight, while they sleep.
The average Tesla home charger cost is around £16.15. 
This figure represents a full charge on a Tesla Model S 100D (battery size 100 kWh).
However, Tesla recommends installing a wall connector for the best home charging experience. Tesla wall connector price There are two types of Tesla wall connector: Gen 3 and Gen 2.
A Gen 3 wall connector costs £499
.
A Gen 2 wall connector costs between £299 and £349
.
The Gen 3 wall connector has wifi connectivity – what’s known as a ‘smart charger’ – which gives you more control over the charging process as well as power-sharing.
These costs are for supply only, and you must be a Tesla vehicle owner to purchase them.
There’s also the option of buying a wall connector pedestal, designed for mounting the Gen 2 or Gen 3 wall connector. This comes in at 
£349
 and is ideal for Tesla owners who need a free-standing structure to support the charging equipment.
Unfortunately, the 
£350 Government grant
 for electric vehicle chargers is not applicable to the Tesla wall connector. Tesla wall charger installation cost Typically, 
Tesla charger installation cost is around £500
.

In This Blog: Sectional garage door cost considerations Sectional garage doors price list Sectional garage door cost of installation Electric sectional garage doors prices Sectional garage doors price key takeaways Have you ever considered installing a sectional garage door? Instead of being made up of just one panel, a sectional garage door is made up of separate sections that rise vertically, so you can avoid losing any driveway space in front of your garage. They also give extra room for wider vehicles like MPVs and four-by-fours.

Whether you choose a single or double door
Whether your door is electric or manual
Whether your door is insulated or not
What material your door is made of
What colours and finishes you choose
Whether you want to add extra locks for additional security

£1,725
 including VAT and installation.

Rubbish removal quotes FAQs Whether you’re undertaking building works, replacing your old furniture, or just having a good old clear-out, we all need to get rid of rubbish every now and again. But what’s the cost of rubbish removal? We’ve taken a look at rubbish removal prices and the different methods available. How much does rubbish removal cost? Rubbish clearance services will often charge you based on the number of cubic yards of waste being collected. However, many will also have set fees for certain items. For example, the typical cost of removing a fridge is 
£75
 while removing a mattress can start at as little as 
£15.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Some rubbish removal services will include a set weight allowance and will charge you extra if you go over it. This could come to as much as 
£30 per kilogram
. Similarly, many will include a set amount of labour in their quote. If you go over that, you could be charged extra too. You’re looking at an average cost of 
£60 per hour
 but this price will vary a lot based on the factors.
Ultimately, the least you can realistically expect to pay for rubbish removal is 
£50.
 At the other end of the scale, you’re probably looking at roughly 
£200
 for a larger ‘man in a van’ service that would be able to take around a skip’s worth of waste. Rubbish removal hourly rates Typically most rubbish removal services are priced based on the type of waste needing to be removed and the size, weight or quantity of the waste. Some services for general house clearance can start from as low as a £27 call-out fee, with an additional charge based on the amount of waste to be removed starting from £45. Rubbish removal hourly rates may also vary depending on your location. Prices tend to be higher in London and the South East but on average you can expect to pay approximately £60 per hour for rubbish removal. Rubbish removal cost calculator Rubbish removal costs vary hugely depending on what method you use. For instance, are you looking for a removal specialist who operates a ‘man with a van’ type service? Or would a skip hire be better suited to your job?
If you opt for a removal specialist, the price will vary based on things like:
How many items need to be removed and their weight.
How awkward the items are to move: For instance, three full bin bags will be easier to handle than one sofa.
What type of waste needs removing: Builders’ waste will need to go to a special facility.
How easy your space is to access: For example, are there flights of stairs? And if so, how many?
Your location: Is parking outside your site free and easy?

Find a man and a van rubbish removal service  How much does it cost to hire a skip? Skips, which typically range between 2-8 cubic yards, can cost between £105 and £295 to hire. Just remember that if you opt for this form of rubbish removal, you’ll need to fill the skip yourself. In contrast, a rubbish removal service will normally enter your home to pick up your rubbish, saving you a job.
Read our  skip hire cost guide  for more detailed information about skip prices. How much does it cost to remove rubble? The cost of rubble removal will depend on a number of factors, such as what type of rubble it is and its weight. Rubble might include waste such as bricks, stone, rocks, patio slabs, plasterboard, tiles, wood or builders’ waste. You’ll usually need to pay more for builders’ waste to be removed because, as we mentioned above, it will need to be transported to a special facility.
If there’s a lot of rubble to remove, it might be cheapest to hire a skip or even a  grab lorry  (hiring one grab lorry will often be more cost-effective than hiring several skips). However, if you’re dealing in smaller amounts, you could consider using a  man with a van service . The average cost of a man with a van is between 
£64 – £94 an hour
 depending on the number of workers required. Just bear in mind that you may need your man with a van to do several trips depending on both the quantity of rubble and its weight.

Find a man and a van rubbish removal service  Rubbish removal quotes If you have some rubbish that you’re looking to have taken away, then it’s time to get some quotes. With any job or project, we always recommend getting a minimum of 3 quotes. This allows you to compare the different prices and services on offer. This is especially important when it comes to rubbish removal, as rates will vary depending on the items and the volume that needs disposing of.
Finding recommended local tradespeople is as easy as entering your postcode into our search bar below. Getting 3 quotes is also quick and easy if you use our  request a quote service . Just submit the details of your project and you’ll receive 3 quotes in return. FAQs What is the cheapest way to get rid of rubbish?
That depends on what type of waste you need to get rid of and how much you have. We’d recommend getting a number of quotes for both skip hire and rubbish removal to find out what the most cost-effective option is for you.
Should I hire a skip or pay for a rubbish removal specialist?
There’s no straightforward answer as everyone’s different. A skip might be cheaper if you’re moving a lot, but if it’s a smaller amount, it could be cheaper to get a rubbish removal specialist. Equally, remember that opting for a rubbish removal specialist will mean less work for you.

All you need to know about rubber cladding,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/rubber-cladding/,Tag Not Found,"All you need to know about rubber cladding

In This Blog: What is rubber wall cladding? What is EPDM cladding? How is rubber cladding used for buildings? Why use rubber cladding? FAQs Rubber cladding is a relatively new building material with lots of benefits.
Most of us have heard of home or wall cladding, which has grown in popularity in recent years. It provides a cost-effective way to give the exterior of a property a face-lift, while also helping to improve insulation.
With the increased demand for eco-friendly building materials, rubber cladding is stepping forward as a viable alternative to  traditional cladding materials  such as timber, uPVC, or fibre cement cladding. What is rubber wall cladding? Rubber wall cladding is a sustainable building material that is often created by upcycling plastic waste. It offers an eco-friendly alternative to using natural resources such as timber.
Discarded items that might have otherwise found their way to landfill can be upcycled to make rubber cladding. What was once a run of guttering or a window frame gets a new lease of life as a durable, super-resilient building material.
But not only does rubber cladding have a lower environmental impact than natural resources it also has the added bonus of being incredibly striking in design. It’s certainly not out of place among the growing trend for black buildings, and can even hold its own sat solo.

Find rubber cladding specialists in your area  What is EPDM cladding? Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (or ‘EPDM’ as it’s commonly known), mirrors many of the qualities of natural rubber but with the added benefit of weathering resistance.
Here are a few more reasons why EPDM cladding is big news:
It’s UV and ozone resistant
It’s waterproof and won’t weather
It’s resilient, flexible, lightweight, and durable
It’s quick and easy to install, and low maintenance
It’s aesthetically pleasing
And, it’ll last for more than 60 years if sprayed in polyurea How is rubber cladding used for buildings? While rubber has been used in the building sector for years, for sound absorption, flooring, and sealants to name just three, the possibilities for using rubber in the construction industry have really opened up.
Demand for epdm rubber roofing is on the rise, as a more cost-effective and durable alternative to traditional felt or tiles.
As we’ve mentioned, some architects are cladding entire buildings in rubber. Others are opting to use rubber as a design statement, contrasting a new (rubber coated) extension against the existing brick facade of a Victorian property, for example. The smooth, consistent colour of the black rubber coating really ‘pops’ against timber, brick, or glass.
As an incredibly flexible material, rubber can also be moulded into any shape, so it’s a great option for buildings with curves or unusual design features. Why use rubber cladding? While it’s not yet considered a conventional building material for external walls, rubber cladding is becoming a more popular choice as people learn to appreciate both its environmental and style credentials.
If you’re interested in using alternative building materials that are more sustainable and create less impact on the environment, rubber cladding might be just what you’re looking for.

Rubber cladding is a sustainable building material that has a low environmental impact. This is due to its reusability, low toxicity, and its impressive lifespan of more than 50 years. Greenpeace International also hailed epdm as a green building material in its “Building the Future: A Guide to Building without PVC” report (October 1996).

How much would it cost to rewire Downton Abbey?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/rewire-downton-abbey-cost/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","How much would it cost to rewire Downton Abbey?

In This Blog: The cost of rewiring Downton Abbey Typical costs included in a rewire FAQs So you’re intrigued to know how much it would cost to rewire Downton Abbey too? Well, keep reading to find out… it’s not cheap!
Downton Abbey is one of the most popular dramas in TV history, with more than 120 million people around the globe having watched the series at one point.
But while we were gripped by the storylines, wowed by the lavish interiors, and hooked on the grandiose of the sprawling estate, we couldn’t help but wonder, “how much would it cost to rewire Downton Abbey?”. The cost of rewiring Downton Abbey Cost provided item

Costs excluded the light fixtures/chandeliers and assumes Highclere castle is 120,000sqft
Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Downton Abbey, known off-screen as Highclere Castle, boasts between 250-300 rooms and has been estimated to be worth a whopping  £72million . So it’s fair to assume since the Carnarvon family took ownership of Highclere in 1679, they’ve been in receipt of some pretty hefty maintenance bills.
All properties will require electrical upgrading at some stage, but can you guess how much it might cost to rewire Downton Abbey? We’re talking 120,000 sq ft of historical property.
Our experts have estimated 
the total cost of rewiring Downton Abbey to be more than £3million!
 And that’s before the cost of new light fixtures and chandeliers, which could even be priceless.
However, compare this to the cost of refurbishing Buckingham Palace – £369million – and it suddenly seems like small change! Typical costs included in a rewire So what does this gigantic estimate cover?
Typically, the cost of a rewire will include:
The removal of old fittings and wiring.
Electrical installation for lighting, emergency lighting, and power to all rooms and communal areas, such as hallways and landings. Average cost 
£171.50 per m2
.
The installation of a fire/smoke detection and alarm system. Average cost 
£25 per m2
.
The installation of security/access controls at an average cost of 
£28 per m2
.
Telephone, data, and TV installation, costing on average, 
£21 per m2
.
Cable containment, at an average cost of 
£19.75 per m2
.
The building management system, which controls and monitors the building’s electrical equipment, such as ventilation, lighting, fire systems, etc. Average cost 
£43 per m2
.
The total cost of these individual items is 
£308.25 per m2
. So the owners of a grand estate such as Highclere Castle can expect to pay north of 
£3million
 to rewire their palatial 11,150 m2 property.

A full rewire costs between

up to £10,000 for a 5-bed house
. Our post on  the cost of rewiring a house  has a full breakdown of costs, depending on the size of the property requiring work.
How long does a house rewire take?
This depends on the size and layout of the property to be rewired, the number of socket outlets, the complexity of the existing wiring system, whether the property is occupied, and where you live. Generally speaking, rewiring a one-bedroom flat can take around 4-7 days, while a 4-bed house can take between 1-2 weeks.

So, if you’re looking to make a career change and want to help the environment, why not consider starting your own solar panel business? Read on to learn how to get started in this booming industry, from creating a business plan to how you can access support.
First steps for starting a solar installation company
Starting a solar installation company doesn’t need to be a complex, confusing journey. This article is designed to guide you through the process and help to get your business off to a great start. So, use the below first steps to hit the ground running:
Research the market and find your USP
: Taking a little time to research the solar panel industry, particularly in your local area can go a long way towards helping you set up your new business. Look at what your competitors are offering and how you can stand out to your customers. You may choose to offer a unique service or even a different type of solar panel.
Come up with a catchy company name: 
Having a catchy name for your company can really help you to attract new customers. Make sure your business name is professional but also memorable and unique.
Decide whether you’ll hire employees
: Hiring employees means extra admin but also a great opportunity to grow your company and increase your turnover. Having an extra pair of hands can be a welcome source of support while creating a positive professional relationship can make your job more rewarding.
Speak to other solar panel installers:
 If you’re completely new to this business, it’s a good idea to get in touch with other professionals to ask for tips and advice. Did you know that if you choose to  become a Checkatrade member , you’ll have access to our members community? This is an online hub for like minded tradespeople to connect and support each other.
Check for Government grants:
 As solar panels have such a positive impact on our environment, the Government has offered grants in the past to encourage more people to make the switch. This is a great way of reaching customers who may not normally have the funds to cover solar panel installation. You should also read up on the  Smart Export Guarantee .
Decide whether you’ll sell/install solar panels
: You could even do both but make sure you don’t overextend yourself, especially when you’re just starting out.
Check you have the right skills and experience:
 Before you can begin installing solar panels, you’ll need the right training and qualifications. You can get these through an apprenticeship or course (more on this later).
Creating a solar panel business plan
While it may seem like extra work, having a bullet proof business plan is the foundation of a successful company. Here you’ll have the chance to explore the ins and outs of how you plan to run your business. Plus, you’ll be creating a document you can refer back to, ensuring you stay on the right track as your company develops.
Cover the following topics in your business plan:
Marketing
Marketing is essential to help you reach customers and build your business. Firstly, consider the type of customers you’ll target, for example, will you work with businesses or homeowners? You then need to work out who your competitors are and how you’ll market your business. You could even offer promotions to draw in more customers.
Legal
Every business needs to consider UK legalities to stay above board. You should check you have any necessary licences and MCS accreditations (more on this later). Insurance is also vital to protect your new company financially and legally. In addition, you’ll need to decide whether to become a  sole trader or limited company.  Finally, don’t forget to register your business with Companies House.
Logistics
This part of your business plan covers the nitty gritty details of how you’ll run your company. Ensure you consider where you’ll operate, what services you’ll offer, what hours you’ll work and whether you’ll hire employees.
Financial
When you start a solar panel installation company, you’ll need funding to cover your start up costs. For example, you’ll need to budget for insurance, tools and equipment, the solar panels themselves, and a van to transport everything from job to job. You should also consider how you’ll cover ongoing costs and ensure you charge enough for your services to make your business profitable.
Don’t forget you’ll also need to pay taxes. If you’re struggling with your company finances, many tradespeople choose to hire an accountant to take on this role, saving you time and a few headaches. Finally, why not open a business account to keep your company finances separate from your personal accounts?

How to handle customer complaints,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-handle-customer-complaints/,Tag Not Found,"How to handle customer complaints

Dealing with customers every day can be a challenge but forming great relationships is essential for your business. While it can be disheartening to receive a customer complaint, this is in fact a great opportunity to learn and grow as a business. Plus, you can easily transform a negative complaint into a positive customer experience by learning how to handle customer complaints properly.
The most important thing to do if you receive a customer complaint is to listen to everything your customer says. This will give you a great understanding of the issue so you can work towards a resolution. Once your customer explains their complaint, try to empathise, and show that you care. It’s also vital that, if necessary, you offer an apology and solution as soon as possible.
Handling angry customer complaints
When things go wrong with a project, many customers become angry and frustrated which can be a stressful experience. The good news is that you can become a pro at handling angry customer complaints and dealing with dissatisfied customers. Firstly, staying calm and polite is incredibly important so you don’t allow the situation to escalate.
As with any customer complaint, allow them to have their say without interrupting so they feel you are giving them your full attention. Remember to never raise your voice or lose your temper with your customer as this is a sure-fire way to increase their anger. Also, try not to allow your customer’s angry words to upset you, it often isn’t personal and they may just be frustrated.
Saying sorry is essential to show your customer you understand their complaint and are taking responsibility. Once your dissatisfied customer finishes explaining their complaint take a little time to investigate the situation. You can then contact them and state how you aim to resolve the issue.
Resolving customer complaints
When a customer posts negative feedback on Checkatrade we’ll contact you before this appears on our website. You’ll then have 7 days to get in touch with your customer and work towards a resolution. This may even lead to the review being withdrawn. To learn more about the process customers go through when making a complaint, check out our  resolving issues guide. After receiving a complaint, you’ll likely want to tackle the problem as soon as possible. This means you can quickly get back to concentrating on your work and eliminate any stress that comes with dealing with an unhappy customer.
In order to properly resolve customer complaints, use the below tips:
Listen carefully to the customer complaint and ask for details for your investigation.
A key step in resolving customer complaints is to look into how the problem occurred and how you can avoid it in the future.
Apologize and show your customer that you empathize.
Ask the customer how they’d like you to resolve the issue, so you know what their ideal outcome is.
Make sure to deal with the complaint as soon as possible.
It’s also helpful to put everything in writing to clear up any confusion over telephone calls.
Speak to your customer after resolving the complaint to check they’re happy with the outcome.
Consider giving them a partial refund, going back to fix the mistake, or tackling any issues with your employees.
If you’re struggling to find a resolution and deal with an angry customer, becoming a  Checkatrade member  will give you access to our Members Community. There you can chat online with other professionals and ask for advice on how to handle customer complaints.
Is the customer always right?
This phrase has been used within businesses for decades but that doesn’t mean the customer is always right. In fact, you may receive a customer complaint about an issue that isn’t your fault which can be incredibly frustrating. For example, sometimes customers may have the wrong information or misunderstand a situation through no fault on your part.
So, what do you do when you receive a complaint over an issue that’s not your responsibility? Well, apologising isn’t always the best course of action, particularly if you’ve done nothing wrong. It’s still worth listening to everything your customer needs to get off their chest and then taking the opportunity to explain the situation.
We’d also recommend keeping detailed records of any correspondence you have with your customer. Plus, it’s important to keep copies of any invoices or quotes you give the customer as this may help to resolve disagreements further into the project.
Rarely, some customers will find things to complain about no matter how hard you work, but as long as you’ve done your job to a high standard, the customer isn’t always right.
What are the six principles of complaints handling?
According to  Ombudsman.org.uk , there are six principles of complaint handling that can help to guide you through resolving customer complaints. You can find more detail on the Ombudsman website but simply these are:
Getting it right
Being customer focused
Being open and accountable
Acting fairly and proportionately
Putting things right
Seeking continuous improvement

Ground source heat pumps: Which type?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/ground-source-heat-pumps-which-type/,Tag Not Found,"Ground source heat pumps: Which type?

Domestic heating has been identified as a key area that needs addressing as the UK strives for ‘net zero’ emissions by 2050. Renewable heating systems have a very important role to play in decarbonising homes, and ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) in particular are emerging as a promising solution.
It’s vital that heating professionals are fully up to date with technology if they are going to capitalise on the changing market and secure work further down the line. Read on as this guide takes you through everything you need to know about GSHPs, from types through to cost, so you can stay ahead of the curve.
If you only have a few minutes to spare, head down to the FAQs section at the bottom of this page for some quick answers.
Which ground source heat pump is the best?
The best type of GSHP will very much depend on the installation. That’s why it’s important to know the ins and outs of each so you can make an informed decision when looking to install a GHSP system.
GSHPs all work in a similar way, using the same mechanism to extract heat from the ground via a heat exchanger. It’s the configuration of the exchanger where these systems tend to differ.
Open-loop heat pump
An open-loop system extracts heat from groundwater which passes through a heat pump. Open loop heat pumps collect water from ponds, lakes or rivers via a large diameter pipe and then expel the water through a separate pipe back to the open water. They can also collect water from underground and expel the water through a separate well back to the aquifer. These systems have the advantage of accessing a constant temperature, but the drawback here is it won’t be able to store heat in the ground between seasons.
Closed-loop heat pump
A closed-loop system instead draws the heat from the ground itself and uses a continuous loop of piping connected to the indoor heat pump. This means it can add heat to the ground and use it as a thermal store. With a closed-loop GSHP, there are several sub-types to choose from.
Horizontal closed-loop systems are laid in trenches. These circulate water and some antifreeze in narrow diameter piping buried in the trenches, usually between one to two meters deep to exchange heat with the adjacent ground.
Vertical closed-loop GSHPs use piping inserted into vertical boreholes up to 200 metres deep to exchange heat with the ground. These boreholes are more expensive but are a useful alternative when there isn’t much outside space available.
Closed-loop systems for ponds are another option. They use piping submerged in open water to exchange heat with the surrounding water and are beneficial when the water quality is too poor to use an open-loop GSHP.
Direct exchange heat pump
A direct exchange (DX) system is unique in that it circulates refrigerant (heat transfer fluid) through highly conductive copper tubing as well as in the heat pump itself. These copper loops are inserted into boreholes between 15-30 metres deep and rely on the refrigerant to absorb heat.
How are GHSPs installed?
The heat pump unit itself will simply be sited inside the property to receive the heated water from the pipes. However, the pipework for the loops can be more complicated to install. For horizontal loops, the pipes can either be straight or coiled and this will purely depend on practicality in each case. Regardless, the pipework will ideally be 1.2 metres below ground with enough spacing between them to collect the right amount of heat.
Vertical or borehole piping will be anywhere from 70-120 metres deep depending on the ground and the size of the heat pump. This will also influence how many boreholes are needed.
Skilled tradespeople get your business started 
Join Checkatrade today  Join Now What size ground source heat pump do I need?
A GSHP will need to be big enough to heat the property, but no more otherwise this will impact efficiency. As a general rule, the bigger the property the bigger the heat pump required. For instance, a 100-square-metre house might need a 4-5kW GSHP, while a 200-square-metre property will probably need double at around 8-10kW.
That said, you’ll have to take into account heat loss and the age of the property to specify the system accurately. To ensure precise heat loss calculations, a few things will need to be kept in mind:
Insulation and building fabrics
Size of radiators and/or underfloor heating
Number of rooms
Types of rooms and their uses
Desired indoor temperature
Seasonal temperature fluctuations
The design of the underfloor heating system and/or radiators might also need to be considered.
The amount of outside space available will also need to be considered as part of sizing a GSHP. A horizontal loop system needs quite a large amount of garden space to be installed. An average family household would need around 600 metres of loops laid into the ground. If the home lacks outside space, a vertical borehole installation is probably the better option as it takes up less room.
Ground source heat pump cost
A standard GSHP system costs anywhere between £2,000-£15,000 depending on the size and other factors. The quality of the heat pump equipment can greatly increase the cost of materials. Not to mention the ground loop and heating systems (such as underfloor heating and radiators), as well as other materials can really hike up the cost of a GSHP installation. Bigger properties will need larger heat pumps, possibly more than one unit, alongside a more complex hydraulic design. Here’s a rough breakdown of costs for reference:
For a two-bedroom house, the heat pump plus installation is likely to cost around £16,000
For a four-bedroom property, the price can rise to £21,000
A GSHP system for a six-bedroom home will cost in the region of £32,000
The cost of the groundwork for installing loops should also be kept in mind. Horizontal systems are usually cheaper to lay, while vertical installations can cost far more.
FAQs
Is planning permission required for installing a GSHP?
GSHP systems are out of sight underground and make less noise than a traditional boiler, so they usually don’t need any planning permission.
Can GSHPs be installed in older homes?
They can be installed in older properties but homeowners should make sure they have good insulation. Otherwise, the amount of heat loss will make the GSHP more expensive to install and run as a larger system will be required.

How to make a window seat Being methodical is the best approach to building a window seat that will stand (or sit) the test of time. And if you’re wondering how to build a bay window seat, it starts the same way as any DIY project – you first need to put down your tools and pick up a pencil.
Step 1: Make a plan
You’ll need to measure the angles of the walls, as each bay window will be different. The standard angle is 135°, but walls aren’t always precisely straight and corners aren’t always perfectly square.
With your angles established, h
ow deep you’d like your seat to be is the next question. Typically a window seat will come out to meet the line of the side walls. Remember that with a bay window, how deep your seat is will also determine how wide it will be, as the more it heads away from the back wall the wider it gets as it follows the angle of the side walls.
Draw it all out as you see it and write your measurements on the paper for when you go shopping for materials.
Step 2: Get the tools and materials
While it’s likely you’ll need all of the tools listed here, this is a generic list of materials as when it comes to how to make a bay window seat that matches your individual vision, you’ll probably need to shop for bespoke supplies to match.
Tools:
Tape measure
Hammer
Pencil
Spirit level
Mitre saw
Electric saw/handsaw
Drill with a drill bit and screwdriver bits
Paintbrush
Materials:
For a standard window seat frame:
Two 10′ 2x4s

Step 3: Construct your window seat
After cutting it to length, fix your piece of 2×4 timber to the back wall at the height you want the seat, allowing for the 3/4″ plywood and seat cushion on top. This will form the rear of the frame, use your spirit level to ensure it’s level.
Using the 2x4s build a wooden frame for the front that sits flush to the side walls. It should be the width you want it to be at the front and level with the rear frame on the wall. At the top and bottom of the sides of your frame, cut 45 degree angles to be flush with the wall.
Inside the front of your frame, add one vertical piece of timber at the centre and two on either side as far left and right as possible for strength. Add more struts on wider frames.
Screw a 2×4 to each sidewall. Again, cut
 45 degree angles at each end to be flush with the rear support and front frame. 
Screw your front frame into these side supports.
Add three 2×4 struts between the front and back walls to support the weight of your window seat users.
Cover the front of your bay window with your g
rooved MDF panel or desired finish.
Cut your 3/4″ plywood to size and place on top. Secure with screws.
Add finishing trim where needed and paint your window seat.
Add a cushion on top and enjoy the view! How to achieve a professional finish A well-built window seat is a great asset for any room and household, providing a space to be enjoyed by all ages for an entire lifetime.
To achieve the very best finish that can be used over and over for yours to come, it’s always advisable to 
use a carpenter
 that knows how to create a window seat to the highest quality level.

Get the help of a recommended carpenter  FAQs about building a window seat How do I build a window seat with storage?
If you want to build a window seat with storage, then follow the process under ‘Step 3: Construct your window seat’ above until you reach point 5. At this stage, position your support struts leaving a gap in the middle to the width of your hinged lid. You may need to add more struts to fully support the weight of users.
Then, when you cut the plywood for the top, cut out a piece to form a lid, add a hinge to the rear of the piece, screw to the plywood top and add a fabric handle. You now have a window seat with storage!
How do I build a window seat with a hinged lid?
Again, follow the process under ‘Step 3: Construct your window seat’ above until you reach point 5, then position your support struts leaving a gap in the middle to the width of your hinged lid. Cut your plywood to size as normal, then cut out a piece to form a lid. Add a hinge to the rear of the piece, screw to the plywood top and add a fabric handle.
How do I build a window seat with cabinets?
To build a window seat with cabinets, follow the process in ‘Step 3: Construct your window seat’ above and when you reach point 3, position your front frame support struts in a way that creates gaps for the number and width of cabinets you want.
Then, when it comes to covering the front of your window seat, instead of an MDF panel you’ll need to build your cabinets to the size of the gaps. Then simply place in the apertures, support the bottoms if needed and secure to the upright struts. Add doors on the front and you have cabinet storage in your window seat!

How to seal a shower screen,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/seal-shower-screen/,Bathroom,"How to seal a shower screen

In This Blog: Tools needed to fit a shower seal How to fit a shower screen seal How to replace a shower screen seal FAQs about fitting a shower seal Whether you’re fitting a brand new shower unit or replacing sealant, knowing how to seal a shower screen the right way is important to prevent potentially damaging and expensive water leaks.
In this guide, we’ll explain how to fit a shower screen seal yourself, including on a curved shower screen and an ‘L’ shaped screen, and reveal how to stop your new shower screen seal from going mouldy. Tools needed to fit a shower seal Fitting a shower screen seal effectively that will stand the test of time (and regular torrents of water!) starts with preparing the tools for the job, as once you get started you’ll want them all close at hand.
The tools you’ll need to fit a shower screen yourself are:
A sealant gun
Anti-fungal sealant
Masking tape
A Stanley knife
Silicone smoothing tool (or your finger)
Damp cloth
Anti-bac wipes (optional)
Thick gloves (for when using Stanley knife) How to fit a shower screen seal Step 1: Remove old sealant
Using your Stanley knife, cut away any old sealant with care, ensuring you don’t damage any surfaces.
If it proves too difficult to remove any small pieces of silicone, a top tip is to use an old plastic card to scrape it away, and if that doesn’t work, then silicone remover is an option.
Step 2: Prep the area
This is essential for an effective and water-tight seal between the shower screen and adjoining surfaces. Use a vacuum cleaner to suck up any dust and deposits, then wipe down the surfaces with a damp cloth and mild detergent.
Step 3: Leave to dry
This is very important as you’ll want to apply the sealant to a dry surface for a strong bond.
Step 4: Protect surfaces
Stick a length of masking tape above and below the join to be sealed, leaving a 5mm gap between. This will protect your tiles, shower screen or shower tray from misplaced sealant and give you a focused working area.
Step 5: Prep the gun
Screw your nozzle onto the end of your sealant tube and cut a 45 degree angle off the top, creating a 5-6mm hole. 
Insert
 into your gun and squeeze the 
trigger
 to tighten up to the tube base.
Step 6: Apply sealant
With gentle pressure on the trigger, s
tart in a corner and apply a bead of 
sealant
 evenly around the shower tray in one constant run. You’re looking to build it up gradually, so if more is needed you can come back and layer it up around until all
 gaps are sealed.
Step 7: Smooth the sealant
Smoothing your 
sealant
 ensures an even and water-tight finish, as well as being essential for the aesthetics of your shower screen. Run your smoothing tool or wet finger along the sealant. Ensure you get this right, as once the silicone has dried it 
will
 be too late to create a finish you’ll be happy to look at every time you use the shower.
You’ll want to achieve a professional finish with your shower sealant, for both the look and to ensure it’s completely water-tight. Use the free search tool below to get quotes from locally recommended tradespeople.

Find bathroom specialists your neighbours rate  How to replace a shower screen seal If your shower screen seal on your hinged, glazed unit needs replacing due to it failing or being mouldy, then you’ll need to buy, cut and fit a new one to prevent potential water damage to your bathroom. Here’s how to fit a removable seal:
Step 1: Remove old seal
Remove the old seal by sliding it off the bottom of the screen.
Step 2: Cut replacement seal
Using it as a template, cut your replacement seal to the same length.
Step 3: Add new seal to screen
Slide it onto the bottom of the screen and close to check it shuts and is water-tight.
Step 4: Test the seal
Next time you use the shower, check water is not passing under the seal. FAQs about fitting a shower seal How do you fit an L shaped shower screen seal?
Fitting an L shaped shower screen seal requires a little more concentration and attention to detail. You’ll need to ensure the corner area of the two panels is successfully sealed and watertight.
Simply follow the steps listed above, and as mentioned: be sure to start in the corner of the ‘L’.
How do you fit a curved shower screen seal?
While the shape of a curved shower screen may seem to throw up more difficulties than a straight unit, there is in fact nothing that adds to the complexity of a curved shower screen installation. Using the steps listed above will help you fit one yourself.
How do you stop sealant from going mouldy?
Mould is a form of life, and all life loves water. Your shower area offers a constant supply of water, humidity and warmth, which are the perfect conditions for mould to exist, so it’s no wonder it occurs so prevalently. Here’s how to clean a shower screen seal and how to prevent mould from growing:
Use an anti-fungal sealant when sealing your shower.
Dry your sealant area after each use.
Clean regularly with a citrus-based shower cleaner.
How do you measure a shower screen seal?
Top tip here, if you’re replacing a removable sealing strip from the bottom of a hinged shower screen, then use the existing one as a template. If you’re fitting a new one, then measure from one end of the bottom of the glass pane to the other. Add a little extra if you’re not feeling confident, as you can always remove and trim it before fitting again.

How to lay block paving,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/lay-block-paving/,Garden,"How to lay block paving

In This Blog: How to lay block paving How to lay a block paving path How to lay a block paving driveway Hiring a professional FAQs Block paving is a great choice for your outdoor space. It’s not only stylish but versatile and durable too. However, in order for it to be durable, it needs to be installed correctly. So if you’re looking to find out how to lay a block paving path, patio or driveway, this guide will take you through the key steps, from getting the materials needed to making sure you create a lasting, level, finish.
For best results, we always recommend hiring a  professional paver . How to lay block paving Getting started
Before starting to lay your block paving, you need to create a design, measure up and gather the necessary equipment and materials.
First, grab a pencil and piece of paper and draw your area of paving, then measure the space to get the m² of paving needed, adding 10-15% for breakages.
Next, prepare your tools and materials, including a:
shovel
broom
rake
mallet
wheelbarrow
compactor
spirit level
tape
string
pegs
screed rails
You’ll also need your sub-base, damp sharp sand, kiln-dried sand and paving stones. How to lay a block paving path Dig out –
 Using your spade, dig out the paving area to a minimum of 15cm below whatever is next to it and bear in mind that this could vary depending on how the land next to your paving area rises and drops. Build in a 1cm drop every 60cm to allow rainwater to drain.
Lay your edging –
 Knowing how to lay block paving edging is essential, and this needs to be done before you put down any paving. Set up a taut string line around the edge of your area at the final height of your paving. Create 10cm concrete foundations coming up to 3cm beneath the line. Sit the edging stones on top and lightly hammer with your mallet down to the level of the string.
Add your sub-base –
 Use hardcore aggregate and apply a sub-base layer to the paving area, at least 10cm deep. Use a compactor to pack down your sub-base.
Top with sand –
 Add a 5cm layer of damp sharp sand on top of the sub-base to elevate the area ready for your block paving. Use a compactor and remember to keep this level, especially on any slopes. Put a string line across the area at the final paving level (adding 3-5mm to allow for compacting).
Lay your blocks –
 Begin laying your paving blocks at the bottom of your slope and in a corner.
Sweep in your sand –
 With your paving laid, sweep your kiln-dried sand into all of the gaps. Compact it, add more sand and repeat until all gaps are gone. How to lay a block paving driveway Installing a block paved correctly is essential, considering the weight of the vehicles that will be driving and resting on it. The key to a successful driveway is compacting. Simply follow the steps above to lay a block paving driveway yourself, or check out our  driveway paving cost guide  to price up your job professionally. Hiring a professional Laying a block paving path, patio or driveway is something you need to get right first time, as mistakes can be costly in terms of both time and money.

Thankfully, you can make a huge difference to the appearance of your decking using the step-by-step instructions in this guide. Read on to learn how to clean decking properly, with tips on cleaning decking grooves, algae and slippery decking. We’ll even cover many of the different approaches including using pressure washers, vinegar, a broom, bleach and dish soap. Should you use a pressure washer? One of the best ways to get impressive results for your decking is to use a pressure washer. These machines deliver high powered streams of water to blast the dirt and grime away. Below, we’ve compared the approaches for cleaning decking with and without a pressure washer:
How to clean decking with a pressure washer
A pressure washer is costly but definitely worth the investment. However, if you don’t know how to use the machine properly, you do risk damaging your decking. To clean decking with a pressure washer correctly, use the below steps:
Choose the right tip and pressure before starting. Make sure to read the manufacturers’ instructions but as a general rule, a pressure of around 500 is suitable for a softwood deck.
Start by testing your pressure washer on a hidden area of decking to ensure you don’t damage the boards.
Sweep the decking to remove any leaves and debris.
You can then start pressure washing.
Keep the pressure washer tip around two feet away from the decking and move in a sweeping motion.
Move the washer away from your home, making sure to overlap the sections so you don’t miss any patches.
Finally, you may wish to use a cleaner or chemical brightener to improve the finish of your decking.
If you don’t want to invest in a pressure washer, or you’re worried about damaging your decking, we recommend hiring a  professional decking cleaner  for best results.
How to clean decking without a pressure washer
To save money, you may prefer to clean your decking without a pressure washer. This method will take longer but can still give a good finish. What’s more, it works really well on decks that have mildew staining. Just follow the below instructions:
Sweep your deck to get rid of any dirt and leaves.
Mix bleach and dish soap with warm water.

Knowing how to clean decking algae is important to keep your decking looking its best and make sure it’s safe to walk over.

Whether it’s pet fur, mud from your shoes or food and drink spills, your carpet is put through its paces every day and can become dirty and stained without regular cleaning. So, to keep your home looking great, today we’ll be looking at how to clean a carpet.
We’ll be covering how to clean different types of stain such as blood or vomit as well as different methods for refreshing your carpet. Plus, we’ll explain how to clean your carpet using vinegar, shampoo, a vacuum, stain remover, a carpet cleaner or baking soda.
Before we get started we should point out that the material your carpet is made from and the type of dirt or stain will dictate the method you should use.
For best results, we always recommend hiring a  professional carpet cleaner . They’ll be equipped with all the right tools and experience to get your carpet looking its best. How to clean carpet at home If it’s been years since you last cleaned your carpet, it’ll likely be very dirty and stained (even if you can’t see it!). Luckily, most carpets can be brought back to life with a bit of TLC. First, you’ll need to gather the following tools and materials:
White vinegar
Salt
Baking soda
Microfiber cloths
Vacuum
Stiff bristled brush
Spray bottle
Here’s how to clean a carpet by hand:
Start by moving as much furniture as you can out of the room before vacuuming your carpet thoroughly to remove any debris.
If you have a lot of pet hair on your carpet, you can also use a squeegee to pick up the hair.
Now, you’ll need to mix three parts of water with one part white vinegar. Fill up your spray bottle with the liquid.
Test on a hidden part of your carpet to ensure the mixture doesn’t stain.
Next, cover the entire carpet making sure it is damp before leaving for at least five minutes to work.
Use your microfibre cloth to absorb as much liquid as possible, also lifting the dirt from the carpet.
Keep rinsing the cloth when it becomes dirty to ensure you’re picking up every trace of grime from your carpet.
You can then leave your carpet to air dry, trying not to walk on it in the meantime.

Find a carpet cleaning company near you  How to clean carpet stains As carpet is so absorbent it’s prone to staining, particularly if it’s a light colour. Luckily, it’s possible to clean carpet stains from all manner of spills and bring your carpet back to life. Check out the following tips for removing different types of stains:
How to clean vomit from carpet
Having children and pets means it’s almost certain that you’ll eventually need to clean vomit out of your carpet. We’d recommend dealing with this as soon as possible to prevent staining.
You simply need to cover the stain with baking soda, leave for 15 mins, vacuum, cover a cloth with a mixture of water, vinegar and dish soap, then blot the stain.
How to clean dried cat urine from carpet
Bringing a cat into your home can be bad news for your carpets. The smell of cat urine is particularly strong, so you’ll want to address this sooner rather than later.
The best way to clean urine from carpet is to use a carpet cleaner liquid made for removing cat urine. Enzyme products are a great choice. You can also use vinegar or baking soda to eliminate any remaining odours.
How to clean blood from carpet
Accidents in the home are unavoidable and you may need to clean blood from your carpet. It’s important to tackle blood stains straight away, if you can, to prevent further damage to your carpet.
To remove blood, mix a small amount of dish soap and cold water, then apply with a cloth. Blot the area and if this doesn’t help you could try using ammonia.
How to clean milk out of carpet
Milk’s less likely to leave visible stains than blood but can still start to smell over time if not dealt with. If you need to get milk out of carpet, start by absorbing as much liquid as you can. Next, mix a tablespoon of dish soap with two warm cups of water and soak up with a cloth. You can then blot the stain and if necessary, use ammonia to remove any lasting odours.
How to clean dog poo off carpet
Dog poo in your home is inevitable if you have a puppy or older dog so it’s essential you know how to properly clean your carpet after any ‘accidents’.
Firstly, remove any solid waste and dispose of it properly. You can then spray a mixture of dish soap, vinegar, and cold water over the stain. Blot with a cloth and finish by sprinkling baking soda over the area before vacuuming after 15 minutes.
How to clean red wine from carpet
Similar to blood, if you spill red wine on your carpet, it’ll be hard to hide the stain. Don’t panic though, there’s a good way of getting red wine out of carpet. Try using white vinegar or dish soap, but if that doesn’t work, we’d recommend trying hydrogen peroxide (just do a patch test first). Absorb the liquid then mix the peroxide with dish soap and blot with a cloth.
How to clean tea stains from carpet
While drinking a warm cup of tea is one of the best ways to relax, tea stains on a carpet can be a real issue.
To remove tea from your carpet, start by blotting with a cloth. Then add a little water to prevent further staining. Apply vinegar mixed with water or a carpet cleaning liquid to the stain and keep blotting using a cloth. Finally, rinse with cool water.
How to clean candle wax off carpet
If you accidentally drip candle wax onto your carpet, it can set into the fibres, making it hard to remove. However, you can get rid of the wax for good using an iron.
To start with, remove as much wax as possible with a blunt knife. Next, place a damp towel over the stain and hold the iron over the towel for 10 seconds. The wax should move from your carpet onto the towel.

Find a carpet cleaning company near you  How to steam clean carpet Another way of giving your carpet a refresh is to use a steam cleaner. Steam is great for lifting dirt out of a carpet and killing off any germs in the process.
Wondering how to steam clean a carpet? Use the following steps:
Move all your furniture out of the way and remove any dust from your skirting board.
Thoroughly vacuum the carpet to remove any dirt that may affect your steam cleaning.
Add water to your steam cleaner and if necessary, add dish soap or carpet cleaner (check the steam cleaner instructions for guidance).
Allow the machine to heat up.
Start away from the door and run the steam cleaner over the carpet in long straight rows. Make sure to overlap your rows to prevent any missed patches of carpet.
Try not to walk over the damp carpet before it has time to dry. This usually takes about eight hours. How to clean carpet stairs The carpet on your stairs sees a lot of foot traffic. This can mean without regular cleaning it can become especially dirty. Use the below tips to revitalise your stairs:
Make sure to regularly vacuum your stairs, lifting the carpet pile so it doesn’t become flattened.
For best results use a carpet cleaner and carpet shampoo.
As stairs are narrow surfaces, make use of the attachments that come with your carpet cleaner.
Remember to clean the vertical surfaces of your stairs as well as the flat surfaces.
If you struggle to lift heavy objects, choose a lightweight cleaner.

Absorb as much of the liquid as possible using a clean cloth. Don’t scrub the stain as this could make it sink deeper into your carpet.
Pick a cleaning spray that’s safe for use on a wool carpet and spray onto a clean cloth.
Blot the stain until it disappears. How to deep clean a carpet If your carpet hasn’t been cleaned in years, the chances are it’ll need a deep clean rather than just vacuuming.

Bleach (ideally with an angled nozzle top to get under the rim)
Rubber gloves
Disinfectant wipes
Paper towels
Microfibre cloth
Old toothbrush How to clean toilet stains If you’re looking to know how to clean a very stained toilet bowl, then follow this step-by-step process to bring your toilet bowl up looking good as new:
Put on your rubber gloves.
Remove as much water as you can from the inside of your toilet bowl.
 Turn off the localised water supply to the toilet if you can. This will expose right down into the U bend.
Take your bleach, place the nozzle under the rim and squeeze as you move the bottle around the bowl.
 The coating will then flow down to the water and all the way around the enamel.
Leave the bleach to work its magic for 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, come back to scrub the bleach away with your soft plastic brush
. Go all the way down and into the U bend if you can.

Find bathroom cleaners your neighbours recommend  How to clean a toilet seat One of the most overlooked places in the house when it comes to cleaning is the toilet seat. It’s one of the most important areas to keep clean since bacteria and other germs can build up over time. Even worse, those germs can then be easily transferred to your hands.
There’s an easy way to keep your toilet seat clean, but also a more thorough way to clean your toilet seat (which is recommended).
The easy way is to simply wipe your toilet seat and lid down with disinfectant wipes, spray the hinge with bathroom cleaner and use an old toothbrush to scrub the awkward areas (don’t mix up your old toothbrush with your current one!).
The proper way to clean a toilet seat thoroguhly is as follows:
Put on your rubber gloves.
Remove the seat from the toilet and lid.
Create your washing liquid –
 aim for a ratio of one part bleach to twenty parts water, or follow the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Ether sit the toilet seat in the solution or apply the solution to the seat and scrub lightly with a soft plastic brush. 
Let the bleach and water mix sit for 
a few minutes. 
Rinse with clean water and dry thoroughly
.
With the seat removed, use the opportunity to thoroughly clean the hinge areas on the toilet. How to clean a toilet cistern The most efficient way to clean a toilet cistern is to use an antibacterial cleaner with enzymes, or you can use a household bleach solution (
one part bleach to twenty parts water
):
Put on your rubber gloves.
Turn the localised water supply to your toilet.
Flush the toilet.
Pour the antibacterial or bleach solution into your toilet cistern
 and leave it overnight.
In the morning, turn the water back on and flush your toilet
.
Rather let a professional do clean your toilet’s cistern?
That’s definitely a sensible way to clean it; making sure you don’t muck up your toilet’s insides!

Find bathroom cleaners your neighbours recommend  How to clean a toilet siphon If your toilet isn’t flushing properly or has trouble refilling after use, then you may need to clean the siphon. Here’s how to do it:
Put on your rubber gloves.
Turn off the localised water supply to the toilet.
Flush the toilet.
Pour vinegar into the cistern.
Scrape the jets under the rim to remove any blockages.
Add baking soda to the cistern.
Turn the water back on and flush.
If your siphon is particularly dirty or clogged, you may need to repeat these steps more than once. However, with a little bit of effort, you should be able to get your siphon clean and your toilet working properly again.
If not, then your toilet may need unblocking, you can find out how to do this in our  toilet unblocking guide  and discover the cost of letting a professional do it in our  toilet unblocking cost guide . How to remove limescale from a toilet Limescale build-up is a common problem for people who live in areas with hard water. Knowing how to remove it can be tricky.
Here are a few methods you can try:
Put on your rubber gloves.
Boil water and pour it over the limescale build-up, then use a brush to scrub the areas.
Pour vinegar over the limescale and let it sit for a few minutes. Use a brush to scrub it off.
Use a commercial cleaner specifically designed to remove limescale.
Whichever method you choose, be sure to rinse the area thoroughly afterwards to remove any remaining chemicals or vinegar. If limescale build-up is severe, it may take a few tries before it’s completely removed. FAQs about cleaning a toilet How do you clean the bottom of a toilet?
Knowing how to clean toilet bowl stains is a key life skill and can transform your experience, and your guests’ experience, of using your toilet. Here’s how to clean the bottom of your toilet:
Put on your rubber gloves.
Turn off the localised water supply to the toilet and flush it.
Pour one cup of vinegar into the toilet bowl.
Swish the solution around with the toilet brush and leave to sit for a minute.
Add one cup of baking soda and another of vinegar.
Leave the solution to fizz for about five minutes.
Scrub the toilet so the solution reaches all the stains.
Flush the toilet.
How do you clean a toilet brush?
There are a few ways that you can clean a toilet brush.
One way is to put on your rubber gloves, pour bleach onto the brush and then rinse it off. Another way is to fill a bucket with hot water and dish soap, and then soak the brush for a few hours.
Whichever way you choose, make sure to clean the brush thoroughly, because if you don’t clean it properly it can become a breeding ground for bacteria. This can cause your toilet to become dirty again very quickly, and it can also be dangerous for your health.
If in doubt, hire a professional bathroom cleaner to take care of it.

How to clean grout in 5 steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/clean-grout/,Bathroom,"How to clean grout in 5 steps

In This Blog: How to clean dirty grout How to clean bathroom grout How to clean grout on floor tiles We recommend professional grout cleaning FAQs about cleaning grout Cleaning grout is a tedious task, but it’s an important part of keeping your kitchen or bathroom looking clean and fresh. This guide will show you how to clean dirty grout yourself without damaging it, including cleaning grout on floor tiles. How to clean dirty grout Whether in the bathroom or kitchen, grout has plenty of opportunities to attract dirt, with its porous nature meaning. And to top it off, grout (particularly white grout) stains easily. This staining can make it hard to bring grout back to its best, but it’s possible to keep it looking bright with some elbow grease, a few household liquids, and a selection of cleaning cloths.
Here’s what you’ll need to clean your grout on your own:
Vinegar
Baking soda
Warm water
Grout cleaner (for really tough stains)
Stiff bristled brush (such as a toothbrush)
Spray bottle
Grout cleaner
Gloves How to clean bathroom grout In this step-by-step guide to cleaning grout, we’ll focus on bathroom grout as that’s most commonly in need of cleaning to remove mould. However, the technique below can equally be used to clean kitchen grout.
Fill your sink with warm water.
Grab your stiff-bristled brush, wet it and then rub the grout
 in a circular motion. Alternatively, fill your spray bottle with warm water, spray and brush in the same way.
Prepare a mix of equal parts warm water and vinegar in your spray bottle.
 Spray it onto the grout and leave for several minutes. Then scrub with your stiff-bristled brush and rinse with warm water.
If your grout is still dirty, create a baking soda paste with warm water and apply it to the grout lines.
 Spray on your vinegar solution and allow it to foam. Scrub with your stiff-bristled brush and rinse with warm water.
For really tough grout stains and mould, you can use a purpose-made
 grout cleaning solution.
 If applying grout cleaner, always follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
If, after all of these steps, your grout is still stained or mouldy, then you may need to re-grout your tiles. You can find out more about the cost of this in our  regrouting cost guide . How to clean grout on floor tiles Cleaning grout on floor tiles can be done in the same way as wall tiles. However, when cleaning floor tile grout there are additional safety aspects to take care of, such as creating a ‘no-walk-zone’ prior to cleaning to remove the risk of someone slipping over on the wet floor.
As floor tiles are subjected to more dirt particles from shoes, pets and food/drink spillages, it may be that you need to try a commercial or industrial strength cleaning product.
Hydrogen peroxide can be used to clean particularly stubborn dirt off of floor tiles, as can chlorine bleach, however, these chemicals should never be used together and should always be used sparingly. If you choose to use these products, follow the manufacturer’s safety instructions and wear gloves, safety goggles and a respiratory mask as a minimum. We recommend professional grout cleaning Cleaning grout is a laborious and time-consuming job, so prepare to set aside a considerable amount of energy and hours to do the job to a satisfactory level.
When you factor in your time and equipment costs, it may be more cost-effective to get a professional in to do the job to the highest standard.
Check out the costs in our  tile grout cleaning cost guide , and find local grout cleaning specialists by entering your postcode in the free search tool below.

Find grout cleaners your neighbours recommend  FAQs about cleaning grout How do you clean grout off a tile?
If you’re wanting to know how to remove grout from a tile surface, it’s very simple to do, unlike cleaning grout itself!
In most cases, you can remove grout on tiles simply by using a hard plastic card to scrape it off, or by using a damp microfibre cloth.
How do you clean grout?
Cleaning grout is a tough job that takes time, but it is possible to do it yourself if you have the right tools and a whole load of patience.
Simply follow the steps listed above to clean your grout.
How do professionals clean grout?
Professional cleaners have their own tools and liquids/products they use to get the best results. Their trade secrets will stay secret, unfortunately.
But this step-by-step guide tells you how to clean grout using a variety of methods, depending on the severity of the mould and dirt embedded in the grout. You can follow these steps to achieve a good finish.
Using a specialist who cleans grout day-in, day-out, will always get the best results.
How do you remove grout?
First of all, you’ll need safety equipment including gloves, a respiratory mask and safety goggles.
Second, lay a dust sheet down below the tiled area to catch all of the removed grout.
Using an electric multi-tool with a rotating cutting disc fitted, gently cut into the surface of the grout and remove as much as possible without touching the tiles.
With the bulk of grout removed, use a flat-head screwdriver to scrape away any remaining pieces and then vacuum with a hose and brush fitting to suck out all of the dust.

Landlord heating obligations – everything you need to know,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/landlord-heating-obligations/,Living Room,"Landlord heating obligations – everything you need to know

In This Blog: Landlord heating obligations Landlord responsibilities for heating Landlord hot water responsibilities FAQs If you’re a landlord, or soon to become one, do you know a landlord’s heating obligations? In this guide, we take a look at the responsibilities a landlord has regarding heating and hot water in their rental property.
As part of the 1985 Tenancy Act, landlords have “to keep in repair and proper working order the installations in the dwelling-house for space heating and heating water”.
According to Landlords insurance providers, damage due to the escape of water from faulty pipes and boilers is one of the most common claims. It’s therefore so important for landlords and their tenants to make sure each party knows their responsibilities when it comes to heating and hot water. Landlord heating obligations Part of a landlord’s heating obligations is to provide some means of heating in every occupied room. This could be by providing a fixed electric or gas heater or central heating via a traditional central heating system or more eco-friendly heating options such as a  heat pump .
If heating is provided through radiators and electric heaters, landlords are obligated to maintain them throughout the tenancy. Whatever heating source is provided, you as the landlord are responsible for annual maintenance checks.
To keep your rental property and your tenants safe, it is recommended to carry out periodic checks during the tenancy. Landlords and tradespeople are allowed access to the property for maintenance checks, but you must notify tenants at least 24 hours beforehand in writing.
As an example, for a landlord to maintain a boiler they must:
Always and only use  Gas Safe registered tradesperson  to  service the boiler  annually. This involves checking the pressure, flue and combustion release are not blocked, the seals are tight, there are no leaks, and all electrical components are all in working order.
Landlords must also provide tenants with a  gas safety certificate As a landlord, you must supply tenants with a copy of the latest  gas safety certificate  (CP-12) before they move in or, if they’re existing tenants, up to 28 days after the most recent service was carried out.
As well as the landlord having heating obligations, tenants are also responsible for correct usage of any heating appliances and reporting any issues or faults. During colder months, tenants may be cautious about keeping heating bills down but as part of their responsibility, tenants must make sure property is kept at 12-15 degrees min to stop pipes from freezing.
Some tenants may want to bring their own portable heaters with them, but some landlords prohibit this for safety reasons, as it can cause grey areas as to who is responsible for maintenance and can cause issues with insurance. Tenants are responsible for any personal items that they have brought with them that were not on the inventory at the start of the tenancy.
If there are any problems with the heating systems, any repairs must be carried out in a ‘reasonable’ time frame. Emergency repairs, for example having no hot water or heating, must be carried out within 24 hours as they are hazardous to health.
It is always worth having the details of a qualified and recommended heating engineer on hand, 
find yours by  searching recommendations in your local area . Landlord responsibilities for heating When it comes to a landlord’s responsibilities for heating, there are regulations that state that the minimum acceptable temperature. The property must be able to maintain a temperature of at least 18°C in sleeping rooms and 21°C in living rooms when the temperature outside is minus 1°C.
If a rental property is not able to be kept at a comfortable temperature, tenants are able to take a landlord to court as it poses a health risk.
As mentioned above, repairs and replacements to a property’s heating system are the landlord’s responsibility. If heating appliances are within warranty then landlords can contact the manufacturer for help and support.
As a landlord, it is possible to claim for certain wear and tear allowances from HMRC, but you cannot claim for a replacement boiler, so it is wise to investigate options for landlord boiler cover. Landlord’s boiler cover  is a type of insurance designed specifically for landlords to cover the boiler and central heating systems in buy-to-let properties. Cover ranges from breakdowns and basic repairs to full replacements, annual servicing, and plumbing cover. These can help give peace of mind to tenants and landlords alike.
To avoid any heating issues it is worth agreeing and organising a regular maintenance inspection to prevent the need for emergency repairs by spotting any potential problems early. As an example,  noisy radiators  may cause tenants concern.
Any radiators must be bled before a tenancy begins, but any ongoing maintenance such as  bleeding the radiators  during the tenancy is the responsibility of the tenants. That being said, most of the time landlords offer to do this as part of their ongoing maintenance works. Landlord hot water responsibilities In addition to responsibilities for heating, landlords are also legally responsible for ensuring that their tenants have hot water at all times. This includes  boiler repairs  but also making sure that the plumbing is capable of delivering hot water to the kitchen, toilets and bathrooms.
Any  loss of hot water  in the winter months is classed as an emergency and needs to be dealt with and repaired immediately. Find a local heating engineer that comes recommended  and keep their details on file.
If tenants notice any problems with the water supply they are responsible for reporting leaks and slow leaks to the landlord to avoid any potential issues arising. To help both the tenant and the landlord, it is advisable to make sure the tenancy agreement clearly outlines which are the landlord’s heating and hot water responsibilities and which belong to the tenants.
A lack of clarity can lead to ending tenancy agreements early or even legal action in the worst-case scenario. FAQs As a landlord, can you control the heat in your rental property?
This usually depends on who is paying for the heating bills. If it’s the tenants, they have the right to fully control their own thermostat. If, however, you as the landlord are paying the bills, you may opt to control the thermostat.

Quartz vs granite cost – which is cheaper?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/quartz-vs-granite-cost/,Kitchen,"Quartz vs granite cost – which is cheaper?

In This Blog: Quartz vs granite cost comparison Factors affecting the price of quartz and granite worktops FAQs Remodelling a kitchen  is not a cheap home improvement, so it’s likely you want to understand just how much your dream worktop might cost. Quartz and granite are two of the most sought-after materials for kitchen worktops, both adding a top-quality finish to any kitchen design.
There are many  factors to consider when choosing between the two . But in this post, we’ll look at granite vs quartz on price.

These costs reflect an average price, for standard quartz and granite worktops. Bear in mind prices can vary depending on the colour and finish chosen.
To 
supply a 5m standard countertop
 (600mm depth):
Quartz
 will cost on average 
£800
Granite
 will cost on average 
£850
To 
supply and install a countertop
 (per m²):
Quartz
 will cost on average 
£375 per m²
Granite
 will cost on average 
£435 per m²
If looking at granite vs quartz cost per square metre, quartz normally comes out slightly cheaper than granite.
Having said that, many experienced granite worktop suppliers and fitters can manipulate the cutting to make granite the more cost-effective option. This is because granite comes in larger slab sizes than quartz. Therefore it’s possible to get all the required pieces from one larger slab of granite, as opposed to two slabs of quartz. Factors affecting the price of quartz and granite worktops When comparing quartz countertops cost vs granite, you’ll see a variance in price depending on:
The size and dimensions of the worktop
The specific type of granite or quartz you choose
There will also be a difference in quartz vs granite countertops price based on the finishes you choose, as outlined in the table below.

Unpolished cutouts.
 This refers to the sections cut out for your hob and sink. If you want to top mount your sink, an unpolished cutout is all that’s needed as it won’t be seen.
Polished cutouts.
 If you’re opting for a butler sink, for example, you need polished cutouts, as you’ll see the edges of the worktop around the sink.
Drainer grooves.
 This is essentially your draining board. Costs average at 
£150 for a set of five
.
Curved corners.
 The worktops will come with square corners as standard. If you want these curved, expect to pay around 
£15 per corner
.
Rounded edges.
 Worktops either have a flat or rounded edge. A flat, or squared edge is standard. To have rounded edges will cost around 
£14 per metre
.
We recommend using these costs as a ballpark and speaking with your local  kitchen worktop fitter  for a detailed quote. Use our handy search function below to find top quality granite and quartz fitters in your area. FAQs Is quartz more expensive than granite?
Granite normally works out more expensive than quartz. However, it’s worth asking your granite worktop supplier if they can get all the pieces needed from one (larger) slab, as this can sometimes work out cheaper than two (smaller) slabs of quartz.
Are quartz countertops more expensive than granite?
Generally, they are fairly similarly priced, but granite can be more expensive depending on the availability of a certain colour and pattern. Quartz can sometimes work out the more expensive of the two due to the treatments it receives during manufacturing.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now When looking at composite fence prices, there are a number of items to price up, which can be seen in our table.
The cost of composite fence panels is normally around 
£120 per panel
. This is for panels that are 21mm thick, 6ft wide x 6ft tall.
In addition to this, you will need to cost up:
A finishing profile (for the top of the panel – 6ft wide) – 
£12 each
A post and cap (we’ve quoted for an aluminium post) – 
£35 each
A post base – 
£13 each
Your installation costs will be separate; these can be found below.
Note: You can expect to pay more for composite fence panels that have a concave or convex top. Composite fence installation cost The cost of composite fence installation averages at 
£28 per metre
. This includes concreting the post bases.
This figure excludes:
Significant groundworks, i.e. breaking out existing concrete or tarmac.
Concrete gravel board, as composite fences are not subject to rot like wooden fence panels.
The waste removal of any existing fence.
Installing gates.
It’s also worth noting that labour may be charged at a minimum day rate. Therefore a smaller job, e.g. to supply and install three fence panels, may be charged at more than 
£130 per metre
.
Tip:
To save on installation costs, composite fence panels can be slotted into existing concrete posts and gravel boards. Contact your local composite fence installation specialist to discuss the requirements of your job.

Find composite fence installers in your area  Factors affecting composite fence panels price The number of panels – the more panels you need, the more it’ll cost.
Height of new fence – as a rule of thumb, the higher the fence, the higher the cost.
The quality of the materials – this can vary from supplier to supplier.
The location of the fence. Hard to access? The installation will likely cost you more.
Waste removal of the old fence. Check whether this is included in the quote you receive from your installer.
Do you need a garden gate? This will be priced up as an additional item.
Comparing the cost of composite fencing against traditional timber fences, composite does come out slightly more expensive, however, there are cost-savings to be made over the lifetime of composite fencing. Firstly, they last longer than wooden fencing, and they do not need to be stained and treated.
Take a look at our  fence panel installation cost guide  to compare the two. Benefits of composite fencing They do not need to be maintained in the same way timber fencing does.
They are environmentally friendly, often made from recycled materials.
Aesthetically, composite panels look and feel very similar to wood.
They are incredibly strong and are likely to flex in strong winds rather than blow over.
They can be used with your existing posts, saving money on installation.

Infrared heating cost,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/infrared-heating-cost/,"Bedroom, Living Room","Infrared heating cost

In This Blog: What does an infrared heater cost to run? Infrared heating cost considerations How much does infrared underfloor heating cost? FAQs Infrared heating cost is a hot topic due to the infrared heating industry being one of the fastest developing areas of new technology.
It provides a cost-effective, efficient, and low-maintenance heating solution for homes and businesses alike.
Infrared provides heat via radiation that’s targeted at the solid objects in a room. These objects absorb the infrared, warm-up, and radiate the heat back out. Convection heating (e.g. traditional radiators and storage heaters) uses the air as a medium for dispersing the heat around a room.
Cost provided item
Unit
Infrared heater
Gas heater
Oil radiator
Running cost of a 500w heater
Per year (based on the heater running for 11 hours each day)
Approx. £50
Approx. £100
Approx. £300
Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now What does an infrared heater cost to run? So what’s the cost of running infrared heating?
The running costs of an infrared panel heater are actually a lot less than gas or oil.
Based on using a 500w infrared heater for around 11 hours a day, you can expect to pay a running cost of around 
£50 per year
, compared with a gas-supplied heater (with the same output and running time) at just over 
£100
. A 500w oil-filled radiator used for around 11 hours a day will cost nearly 
£300
.

Find heating engineers your neighbours recommend  Infrared heating cost considerations In addition to the lower running costs, there are also other cost benefits to infrared heating:
The panels are relatively cheap, ranging from 
£125 – £180 
for a single heater panel.
Low installation costs, starting at around 
£75 per square metre 
for underfloor heating.
Zero maintenance costs.
No heat is lost to draughts as infrared heats solid objects rather than the air. This makes it really efficient.
Infrared heaters can often be controlled individually using a wireless connection. This allows you to only heat the rooms you need to, therefore saving money. How much does infrared underfloor heating cost? Infrared  underfloor heating costs  around 
£75 per square metre
 to install. This can vary depending on the level of work that needs to go into laying the underfloor heating and what type of system you choose.
To offer a comparison, the  cost of wet underfloor heating  ranges from 
£120 per m²
 in a new build property to anything up to 
£185 per m²
 as part of a renovation.
There are definitely cost savings to be made in choosing infrared heating, and with the government striving towards a carbon Net Zero target by 2050, selecting a more environmentally-friendly source of heat for your home might not be a bad decision.
Use our search function below to find a heating engineer in your local area, or use our  request a quote  feature to receive quotes for installing infrared heating in your home. FAQs What are the pros and cons of infrared heating panels?
Infrared heating panels are 100% efficient, unlike gas central heating, for example.
With infrared, no heat is lost through draughty windows, it’s an eco-friendly way to heat your home, and is much more affordable than a  heat pump . The panels are super slim, and it’s also thought to promote a healthier environment within the home as it maintains humidity and doesn’t circulate dust around the room.
You can control the heat room-by-room with infrared heating, compared with gas central heating, which heats the entire home. You will also get the same warmth from infrared heating even if it’s set at a lower temperature than traditional heating, which reduces your heating costs. What’s more, infrared heating warms a room much quicker than traditional heating.
Overall, it is much cheaper to heat your home using infrared heating, compared with gas.
However, make sure to select infrared panels manufactured with safety in mind. The coils of infrared heaters can be extremely hot, so opt for a heater that’s encased in a cool-to-the-touch cabinet.
Infrared heat travels in a straight line, therefore multiple people might not benefit from one heater in a room at the same time. Consult with a  heating engineer  to make sure you select infrared heaters that will suit the needs of you and your home.
What are the dangers of infrared heating panels?
Infrared heating panels use something called ‘Far Infrared’. This is not to be confused with ‘Near Infrared’, which produces heat that’s much more intense, penetrative, and potentially unsafe. Infrared heating panels are not dangerous.

Landlord plumbing responsibilities,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/landlord-plumbing-responsibilities/,"Bathroom, Kitchen","Landlord plumbing responsibilities

In This Blog: Landlord plumbing responsibilities Landlord responsibility for sinks, baths, and toilets Landlord responsibility for pipes and drains Landlord responsibility for the boiler and radiators FAQs With so many sanitary fixtures and fittings in a property, not to mention pipes and drains, it can be confusing knowing where the land lies when things go wrong. So what are a landlord’s plumbing responsibilities and what falls to the tenant to fix and maintain?
In this post, we’ll look at the typical sanitary conveniences in a property (sinks, baths, toilets, pipes, and drains), and outline who’s responsible should you be faced with a blocked sink, burst pipe, or dripping tap in your rental property. Landlord plumbing responsibilities Legally, a landlord must provide tenants with running water and sanitation fittings in order to use it. This includes pipes and drains.
Therefore a tenanted property must have:
A working toilet
A shower or a bathroom
At least one sink for washing up
The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 requires property owners to keep in repair and proper working order the installations in the dwelling for the supply of water, gas, electricity, and for sanitation (including basins, sinks, baths, and sanitary conveniences), but not other fixtures, fittings, and appliances for making use of the supply of water, gas or electricity.
Let’s look at what that means for some of the most common sanitation ware in a property. Landlord responsibility for sinks, baths, and toilets It is a landlord’s responsibility to maintain the drainage, pipes, and other areas of plumbing in a tenanted property. A landlord is therefore responsible for repairs to:
Sinks
Baths
Toilets
However, a tenant is liable for the cost of repairs should a drain become blocked due to tenant misuse.
The same applies to the sanitary ware itself. If a sink, bath, or toilet is damaged due to tenant misuse, the tenant is liable for the cost of repair or replacement. If the damage is caused by wear and tear or faulty installation, the responsibility sits with the landlord.
A tenant is responsible for plugs and chains for sinks, baths, and basins.
For a plumber to fix a dripping tap, you’re looking at around 
£100
. A toilet could cost in the region of 
£110
 to put right. On average, a plumber will charge around 
£50/hr
. Take a look at our  guide to plumber costs  for more information. Landlord responsibility for pipes and drains Internal pipes
A leaking pipe within the property could be caused by the tiniest of fractures in the pipework or a loose connection. A leaking pipe will present itself as a puddle under the pipework, or damp patches on the walls or ceilings if the pipes are concealed.
Repairs to leaking pipes within the property are the landlord’s responsibility, and for a plumber to fix will cost around 
£100
.
Pipes are also at the mercy of the elements. Cold weather can cause the water within the pipes to freeze, expand, and then burst the pipes.
Should this happen, again, it’s the landlord’s responsibility. This type of job normally costs between 
£160 – £310
 for repairs. As this will likely be an emergency call-out, the cost will be higher, especially if out of hours.
Tip: To prevent flooding and minimise water damage, make sure both landlord and tenant know how to shut off the water supply to the property.
External pipes
The mains pipe (which brings water to the property) will either be the responsibility of the landlord or the water board. In the event of a leaking mains pipe, the landlord should contact the local water board to find out if it’s the water board’s or the landlord’s responsibility to fix it.
If the pipes 
are
 the landlord’s responsibility, expect to pay around 
£235
 to fix a leaking pipe. This is dependent on the scale of the repair.
Drains
At the tenanted property, the landlord is responsible for clearing blocked:
Sewers
Drains
External waste pipes
A landlord is NOT responsible for road gullies or waste pipes blocked by tenant misuse.
A list of helpful property maintenance costs can be found  here . Landlord responsibility for the boiler and radiators Boiler
A landlord is legally required to make sure the  boiler is serviced  and safe for continued use.
A landlord should instruct a Gas Safe registered engineer to inspect the gas supply and appliances in a rental property at least every 12 months. Take a look at our guide on the  landlord responsibilities for the boiler and gas safety  for more information
Radiators
A landlord is also responsible for:
Radiators, pipework, fittings, and valves
Should a  radiator need fixing , for example, due to a leak, the cost is around 
£120
.
A tenant must never attempt repairs themselves unless the tenancy agreement explicitly states otherwise. A tenant should never feel obligated to undertake repairs that are the landlord’s responsibility.
However, if a tenant’s actions cause damage to the property or adjoining properties, the tenant is responsible for paying to put it right. A good example would be if the tenant leaves a tap running, causing a bath to overflow, damaging the property below. The tenant is responsible for the cost of repair to both properties in this instance.

Is a burst pipe landlord or tenant responsibility?
A burst pipe is normally the landlord’s responsibility.

Paint problems and solutions,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/paint-problems-and-solutions/,"Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Paint problems and solutions

In This Blog: Common painting problems and solutions Radiator painting problems Ceiling painting problems Problems painting with a roller Interior painting problems Wall painting problems Exterior painting problems How to paint How to get flawless results How much does professional painting cost? While the process of painting seems relatively simple, many people struggle to perfect the technique. This can lead to flaking, cracking, blistering and other paint issues. Spending hours painting a room only to have poor results can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you need to start from scratch. That’s why we’ve created this guide covering paint problems and solutions.
Whether you’re using the wrong paint, not properly preparing your surfaces or are using the wrong technique, we can show you some expert hacks. 
However, the best way to make sure you don’t have any DIY paint disasters is to hire a  professional painter and decorator .
 That way, you’ll get perfect results every time.
If you’ve already done it yourself and have got problems, read on to find out how to sort it. Common painting problems and solutions No matter what struggles you are having with painting, you can be sure there’s a great way of avoiding it in the future. This could be by doing extra preparation or even learning a new method for painting. So, let’s look at some of the most common painting problems and their solutions:
Bumps from filler
: If you repair any kind of crack in your wall it’s essential that you take the time to file down the filler. You can use sandpaper to do this and you’ll need to keep sanding until the filler is completely flush with the wall.
Blistering or flaking
: Usually this happens when either moisture or dirt becomes stuck under your paint. In order to fix this problem, you’ll need to sand away the blistered paint, then use a primer to cover the area before repainting.
Mould:
 Sometimes your paint can become covered in mould which is not only unsightly but can affect your health. Thankfully, you can buy fungicidal wash to kill the mould before repainting.
Wrinkling
: If your paint becomes wrinkled or starts to shrivel, this normally means the paint was applied too thickly or you didn’t wait long enough between coats. Once the paint is fully dry, sand it and clean it before painting again.
Stains:
 Sometimes stains can show through your paint, especially if you’re using a light colour. The best remedy for this is to use extra primer to cover the stain before painting.
Cracks
: Plaster underneath your paint can crack, particularly in new homes. You’ll need to fill any cracks before sanding down and repainting to fix this problem.

Find painters your neighbours recommend  Radiator painting problems One of the biggest problems when painting radiators is using the wrong type of paint. You can’t use normal paint on a radiator as this will cause the paint to expand and shrink as the radiator heats up and cools down throughout the day. This leads to cracks, flakes and discolouration. You can fix this issue by using a radiator primer, then a paint that is suitable for radiators. Ceiling painting problems If you’re painting your walls with a roller, the chances are you’re going to accidentally get paint on your ceiling. That’s why using painters tape to protect your ceiling is so important.
Another common challenge is painting over popcorn textured surfaces. It’s always worth checking a small section to see how it turns out, without painting the whole ceiling. If the popcorn starts to fall off the ceiling when painted, you’ll need to remove this before you paint the whole ceiling.
Some people end up with a messy paint job as they only use the roller in one direction. You can prevent this by working quickly before the edge of your previous line dries (this technique is called keeping a wet edge). Problems painting with a roller Many people experience spattering when using a roller for the first time, and this is one of the most common problems painting with a roller.
This is usually due to applying your paint too quickly causing small drops of paint to cover the surrounding surface.
In addition, you should always keep a wet edge when painting with a roller to avoid roller marks. Interior painting problems The problems most often encountered when painting interiors include yellowing, wrinkling, cracking and mould. All of these can be repaired although it will take a little time to fix the issues. Remember, you can use a fungicidal wash to kill mould and you can sand down your paint to get rid of wrinkles or cracks. When it comes to yellowing, this can be prevented by using water-based paint. Wall painting problems Here are some other issues you may encounter when painting your walls:
Spillage after not putting the lid back on the paint properly.
Interruptions from pets and children. It’s best to keep them away to avoid smudged paint.
Paint in places you don’t want it to be. In order to avoid this, make sure you cover your floor and all your furniture. Exterior painting problems The paint outside your home needs to be very durable to ensure it lasts for years without being damaged by the weather. Here are some of the different exterior painting problems you may experience:
Efflorescence
: Caused by salts in the masonry of your home, this can produce white deposits that ruin your paintwork. You can fix this by repairing any areas where moisture is getting into your masonry. Then remove the bubbles, deposits, and flakes before treating with trisodium phosphate and repainting.
Blistering:
 Caused by painting your home on a hot day or painting over damp wood, blistering can be fixed by sanding away the damaged paint, priming, then painting on a cool, dry day.
Chalking:
 Caused by using poor quality paint or poor application techniques, chalky powder can build up on your walls. You’ll need to properly scrub the surface, removing any chalking before treating with trisodium phosphate and repainting.

Find painters your neighbours recommend  How to paint Thankfully, you can avoid many paint problems by following a proper guide on how to paint.

Projects without planning permission,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/building-without-planning-permission/,"Garage, Garden, Kitchen, Living Room","Projects without planning permission

In This Blog: What is outline planning permission? Land for sale with planning permission What is retrospective planning permission? How much does planning permission cost? Which tradesperson should I use for the job? FAQs Planning permission is a key part of many construction projects ranging from extensions to conversions and building new structures. This means, if you have plans to renovate your home, you’ll need to check whether permission is required and follow the correct application process. However, did you know it’s possible to complete certain projects without planning permission in the UK?
Planning permission applications can be very time consuming, which can cause delays in home improvement projects. So, if you’re eager to get started, why not choose a job that doesn’t need planning permission? The following projects don’t require planning permission, so it may be worth altering your plans if you are in a hurry:
Most  loft conversions Single storey extensions that are less than four metres from the rear of your home
Internal renovations/improvements like layout changes and cosmetic changes
Adding new windows or  skylights Most  basement conversions Installing  solar panels Porches
Most  garage conversions Certain types of  garden rooms 
Find builders your neighbours recommend  What is outline planning permission? When you submit a planning permission application to your local council, you’ll need to give a detailed description of your plans. In order to save time and get a preliminary go ahead, you can submit an outline planning permission application instead. Here, you give a brief explanation of your project plans, ahead of an in-depth application.
If outline planning permission is denied, you’ll have saved yourself the time of filling in a full application. Land for sale with planning permission If you’re hoping to build your own home, it may be possible to buy a plot of land for sale with planning permission. Depending on the scale of your plans, this can save you the cost and time of submitting a planning permission application once you’ve purchased the land. You can find land for sale with planning permission online, but contacting a real estate agent can also be a good option.
If you’re considering buying a piece of land where you have permission to build your dream home, it’s worth checking exactly what construction is permitted. Generally, there will be restrictions or conditions on the permission which may interfere with your plans. What is retrospective planning permission? Planning permission is a legal requirement for certain types of projects, so it’s important to check whether this is necessary before beginning. If you do build without planning permission, you could face penalties and an enforcement notice to undo your alterations. However, you can choose to apply for retrospective planning permission after construction has started.
Our  retrospective planning permission guide  covers everything important that you need to know. It includes advice about building control, breach of planning conditions, and applying for retrospective planning permission. How much does planning permission cost? If you’re taking on a project that requires planning permission, you’re probably wondering about average costs. Luckily, our  planning permission cost guide  is bursting with prices and more.
For reference, the price for a full planning permission application for a new single dwelling house is £426. What’s more, our  retrospective planning permission guide  also includes average prices. Which tradesperson should I use for the job? When making construction plans, you’ll need to use tradespeople with a range of skills. Instead of searching for endless professionals, why not try our  request a quote feature ? Just give us the details of your job and we’ll pass these onto three local experts. They’ll either ask for further information or send you a quote, it really is that easy!

Find builders your neighbours recommend  FAQs Do I need planning permission?
This will depend on what exactly you plan to build and the scale of your project. For example, a double-storey extension will need planning permission, while a small, single-storey extension may not. It’s always worth checking if you need planning permission before you start construction.
How long does planning permission take?
Often this will come down to your local authority but as a general rule, it’ll take about eight weeks for a decision. Having said that, particularly large or complicated applications may take up to 13 weeks.
How long does planning permission last?
While some types of planning permission may last longer, you’ll usually have up to three years to action your plans.
How can I search for planning permission?
If you’re curious about upcoming local developments, you can search online at the  government website  There you’ll find your local authority where you can check different types of planning applications.
Do you need planning permission for a conservatory?
You won’t usually need conservatory planning permission unless you plan to build a large or complex conservatory. You can read more about adding a conservatory to your home in our  conservatory guide. Do you need planning permission for a loft conversion?
Loft conversions are usually internal alterations that won’t affect the appearance of your home. This means you generally won’t need loft conversion planning permission.
Take a look at our  loft conversion planning guide  for all you need to know about the conversion process.
Do I need planning permission for a shed?
Usually adding a shed to your garden is considered permitted development. This means you won’t need planning permission before you can build your new shed. It’s worth noting that if you intend to transform your shed into extra living space, you probably will need planning permission.
Check out our  shed planning permission guide  for more information.
Do I need planning permission for a garage?
Most garages fall under the umbrella of outbuildings which are often considered to be permitted developments. As long as your garage is small and isn’t designed to be lived in, you generally won’t need planning permission.
Take a look at our  garage planning permission guide  to learn more.
Do you need planning permission to convert a garage?
If you only plan to make internal changes to your garage, it’s likely you won’t need planning permission. However, to add a garage extension, an extra floor, or to make extensive external alterations, you may still need planning permission.
You can find out more in our  garage planning permission guide. Do you need planning permission for an extension?
Again, this will depend on the type and size of the extension you’re planning to build. As long as your extension falls into  permitted development , you won’t need planning permission. If you’re unsure, our  extension planning permission guide  tells you everything you need to know.
Do you need planning permission for a summer house?
Most  summer houses  aren’t considered permanent structures and aren’t designed to be lived in. This means, you usually won’t require planning permission to build a new summer house.

Homeowners often render their modern or contemporary homes to ensure a clean finish. However, render is also used on homes that require more specialist applications, such as period properties or grade-listed buildings. There are various types of finishes available (all with different properties and uses), which means homeowners can render any type of external wall. Also, because of the range of materials on the market, there are multiple styles and designs that can be mixed and matched to achieve the ideal result.
However, with great choices comes great indecision. And with the sheer number of options available, it’s hard to know which to choose when it comes to designing your external aesthetic. So, read on for our expert advice on the various types of render available and which one we recommend adding to your type of property.

Hire a rendering expert your neighbours trust  The best type of external render for your home When it comes to rendering your house, think of it in the same way you think about plastering your interior walls. The reason you plaster is to protect the underlying walls and provide an attractive finish to decorate. Render is similar, except it also protects your home from external weather conditions and stops rainwater penetration.
House rendering is very popular with homeowners. With its simple texture and range of colours, render is a versatile choice for either mixing and matching with other materials or using by itself. Other benefits include protection from damp and greater energy efficiency (if using acrylic insulated makes).
However, it’s worth noting that render isn’t the cheapest option, which is why mixing and matching it is sometimes preferable. That’s why it’s important to choose the right render and properly protect it to make sure it lasts as long as possible. A well-applied render has a life expectancy of 20-30 years, so getting it right from the start is worth the investment.

Types of external render finishes So, what is the best type of external render for your home? There are several types to choose from, all with various properties.
Monocouche renders
Monocouche is French for ‘single layer’ or ‘bed’ renders. They’re the newest type of render and offer the traditional benefits of lime render such as texture and flexibility (which helps stop cracking) combined with a hard-wearing, weather-resistant, and low-maintenance finish. It also looks really good.
You can apply monocouche through a spray or hand trowel. It comes in bags to pour into a bucket and mix with water as per the instructions. It has a traditional white or sandy/lime finish, which is why there are coloured renders now available. Typically applied using one coat, monocouche render is quicker and less labour intensive than other products on this list. However, the render itself is more expensive at an average cost of 
£65 per m2
.
Read our  cost of monocouche rendering  for more information.
Lime render
If you own an old property, your best rendering option is a lime mix. Lime offers a breathable finish and lets the house perform how it’s meant to. Lime render is trickier to apply. However, it’s nothing a professional won’t be able to handle. Also, certain types are polymer-enhanced, which overcome any difficulties when it comes to application.
Not only that, but a lime render is more flexible, stops moistures being trapped within the wall, and offers an attractive finish. However, it does need regular lime wash coatings to maintain its attractiveness. Because of these benefits, it’s slightly more expensive than other types of render materials. However, for period properties, it’s a must.
Cement render
Cement renders are usually the cheapest on the market in terms of materials. However, they’re more expensive when it comes to labour due to the numerous coats it requires. They tend to be mixed onsite before they’re applied in two or three coats. Not only that, but cement renders are rigid and prone to cracking over time, which allows rain penetration, frost damage, and loosened bonds. To ensure they remain attractive, they require more maintenance and regular touch-ups.
Acrylic renders
Homeowners often apply acrylic renders to their homes to enhance or seal the existing underlying coat. Usually applied as a thin finish, they sometimes offer alternative colours or textures. Furthermore, added fibres prevent cracking and give a durable, lasting finish.
Polymer render
Sold in pre-mixed bags, Polymer renders are also cheaper versions of traditional render due to their white cement or lime base. However, because of the plastic-based product that’s added, the render is less prone to cracking. Also, they’re available in a variety of colours, which eradicates the need to paint on top and keeps costs down.
Silicone render
Silicone is a versatile material that’s used for greater longevity and easy maintenance. With some purported self-cleaning credentials, homeowners have reported that when it rains, the water washes away any dirt on the render. FAQs What is the best type of house render?
Silicone renders are easy to apply, hydrophobic, and flexible (which makes them less likely to crack). However, for older properties that need to breathe, lime render is a better option.

What central heating engineers need to know about heat pumps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/what-central-heating-engineers-need-to-know-about-heat-pumps/,Tag Not Found,"What central heating engineers need to know about heat pumps

As sustainability becomes a major consideration for the domestic heating industry, heating engineers will need to be aware of the increasing demand for renewable heating systems. Heat pumps are emerging as one of the most popular technologies and the government has even pledged to fit 600,000 every year until 2028.
Tradespeople will need to know how to install these systems so they can develop their skills. And it’s even more important to get up to speed if you’re self-employed and want to futureproof your business and meet customer demand.
This guide will take you through everything you need to know about central heating engineering and heat pumps. In a hurry? Head to the FAQs section at the bottom of this page for a quick overview.
What to know about heat pumps
Heat pumps are powered by electricity and are a way of heating the home without producing harmful emissions. There are different types of heat pumps, but air source heat pumps (ASHPs) are smaller in size and less disruptive to install, making them the most logical replacement for gas boilers in homes.
It’s a good idea to get familiar with these systems if you’re looking for profitable domestic work. For more advice on making ASHPs a part of your business, check out our guide  here .
In simple terms, an ASHP is a system that absorbs heat from the outdoor air. It then draws this in via a unit that is placed outside with a fan, which then compresses into liquid using electricity. The hot water gained from this process is then kept in a storage cylinder inside the home, which can supply radiators, taps and other appliances with the necessary heating.
ASHPs are mainly used for space heating through radiators or underfloor heating systems, but they can also heat water for use in a home. Ground source heat pumps, as the name suggests, get their thermal energy from soil or a water body outside a property.
Due to their low heat output, ASHPs are unable to heat water instantly, which is why a hot water storage cylinder must also be installed. As such, there are two components to an ASHP system: the pump itself which is installed outside the property, and a hot water cylinder which is placed inside the home.
Why are heat pumps an eco-friendly alternative?
An AHSP is different to a boiler as it will run at a consistent low temperature using less electrical energy than the heat it produces. The unit can get heat from the air even when the temperature is as low as -25°C.  Energy consumption drops and heating bills will be lower when an ASHP is installed. Less energy used means the home’s carbon footprint will also be cut significantly. This makes for a highly efficient as well as renewable heating system.
Heat pump installation training
It’s definitely worth getting trained and accredited if you’re working with new technology that customers are unfamiliar with. This way, you can assure people that the product they’re investing in is going to be effective, plus it’s always good to demonstrate your knowledge as this will travel word-of-mouth.
Many homeowners will want to qualify their installation via the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). The RHI is a government scheme that was introduced to encourage homeowners to use more renewable technologies. It pays those with eligible renewable heating systems for the energy they generate and is intended to reimburse the owner for up to 80% of the upfront installation cost over seven years. To qualify for the RHI, an AHSP must be installed by an MCS-accredited installer.
The Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) provides a directory of approved installers to ensure that high standards of performance are met. All installers under the scheme are vetted to be technically safe and competent. You are also required to undergo formal assessment to determine whether scheme requirements can be met.
Clients will seek out this accreditation so they can qualify their installation through the RHI, so it’s worth sorting to maximise your future business opportunities.

Working closely with manufacturers is important for smoothly planning and installing ASHPs. But there are several other factors you’ll need to consider as part of the process.
Assessments
Like conventional boilers, ASHPs are given output (size) ratings in kilowatts (kW), which tell you how powerful a heat pump is. The output required will depend on the size of the home and how well insulated it is. There’s no ‘one size fits all’, and each house type needs to be individually assessed, however most manufacturers provide an air source heat pump installation diagram as a general guide.
The heat pump will need to be specified depending on the outside air temperature and how often it changes. This is an important aspect because if it isn’t factored in, the heat pump may not be able to extract enough heat during low temperatures and could leave customers with a cold home at the worst possible time.
Placement 
Heat pumps are low-temperature systems, which means that they need a larger surface area to achieve enough heat output. You’ll need to be able to advise homeowners on whether their radiators are sized appropriately for a heat pump to be installed. You can make this decision by completing accurate heat loss calculations for each room in the property.
Keep in mind the pump can be fitted to a wall or placed on the ground – but it will need plenty of space around it to get a good flow of air or the system won’t be able to perform properly.
Engineers will also need to make sure the storage cylinder is suitable for a heat pump, as the cylinders found in traditional boiler systems tend to be inefficient and might lack the coil size required to transfer enough heat. It’s probably best to speak to the customer about installing a low-temperature-ready cylinder as these have a larger coil surface to sufficiently heat the water.
Fitting 
When installing, consider the space needed for both the heat pump and the cylinder. The cylinder can often be fitted in the same place as an old boiler, so no major structural changes are required. The pump, however, will need enough room to work effectively. If space is at a premium, you may be able to find a way around this by mounting the heat pump against a wall or even placing it inside a loft cavity.
Heat pump systems operate at higher flow rates than boilers, which means the correct pipe size must be kept in mind when designing a system. There are a lot of newer homes which contain microbore pipework that may not be able to provide sufficient water flow for heat transfer. In these cases, you might have to install additional equipment or replacement pipework.
While the exact figure isn’t known, domestic heating specialists estimate that a significant number of UK homes contain microbore pipes. Be sure to establish what a customer’s home is fitted with before moving ahead with purchasing and installation.
FAQs
Can heat pumps both heat and cool a home?
Heat pumps heat homes by extracting warmth from outside and then transferring it into a property. When it’s warm outside, the heat pump will reverse directions and act as an air conditioner, removing heat from the home.
How much does a heat pump cost?
It’s not the easiest to estimate as there are several things to consider when having one installed such as the size of property, the pipework and the air temperature. That said, heat pumps tend to range from £7,000-£40,000.
What are all the components of a heat pump? 
The main components of a heat pump are:
Outdoor pump unit
Internal storage cylinder
Air handler
Line set
Variable-speed blower motor
Heater pack
What maintenance does a heat pump require?
Regular monitoring and maintenance are essential for extending a heat pump’s lifespan. The equipment will need to be kept clean and checked yearly. This can include making sure the coils haven’t frozen, cleaning the air filter and fan blades, as well as checking the electrical connections.
What are the four basic types of heat pumps?
The main four types of heat pumps are:
Air source heat pump
Ground source heat pump
Water source heat pump
Exhaust air heat pump

What construction businesses need to know about natural building materials,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/what-construction-businesses-need-to-know-about-natural-building-materials/,Tag Not Found,"What construction businesses need to know about natural building materials

Buildings account for a significant portion of the UK’s total carbon emissions and the construction process is a major factor in that total figure. Much like other trades, there’s now a drive to raise sustainability and limit construction’s impact on the environment.
The materials used during the build process are no exception to these efforts and most manufacturers are now producing greener products to limit the amount that ends up in landfill or incinerators.
Customers are becoming increasingly conscious of their purchasing habits and how they affect the environment. As such, it makes sense for businesses to be aware of the alternatives out there and how they can replace traditional approaches. Read on as this guide takes you through everything you need to know to start building greener.
In a hurry? Scroll down to the FAQs section for a quick overview.
What construction companies need to know about natural building materials
Natural building materials use less energy when being produced. They will also be made of recyclable products, or be re-usable or bio-degradable at the end of their life. They are also less likely to emit toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which ate harmful chemicals found in traditional building materials. VOCs are linked to a number of health effects, such as Sick Building Syndrome.
It’s rare to find housing developments made from only natural materials. But it’s possible to swap out many traditional materials in place of more sustainable ones, which can help to lower the amount of ‘embodied’ carbon in a build. This is the emissions total that’s calculated from all the energy used during construction.
How to build sustainably
It’s not difficult to prioritise sustainability into your building design plans, so long as you start planning from the start. Through the careful choice of building materials and construction methods, you will be able to build greener homes that bring a number of benefits.
It’s a common issue for buildings to be built with too little insulation, so be sure to use enough. The more insulation you incorporate into the structure of a home, such as the walls, roof and floor, the more heat it will retain and the more efficient it will be when in use. If you are particularly interested in insulation methods and considering starting a business in this line of work, check out our guide  here .
Your building design should also factor in airtightness. Fewer gaps and cracks in a home’s structure means less heat is lost to the outside as a result. Many natural building resources also offer good insulation and should be used as much as possible. This will improve thermal performance and is less hazardous when compared to fibreglass-based products.
Greener materials are a simple way to raise sustainability when building a more environmentally friendly house but are often overlooked. While sometimes more expensive, the typically perform on par or better than more traditional options so it’s worth doing your research first.
Sustainable construction materials list
Wholly natural building materials include:
Timber
Clay
Wool
Cob
Straw bale
Cork
Hemp
Reclaimed materials
Lime
Stone
Marble
It’s important to note that things like iron, aluminium, glass and concrete aren’t classified as ‘natural’ despite being made from naturally occurring materials. This is because it takes so much energy to turn them into something useable.

Join Checkatrade today  Join Now Sustainable materials in construction
Timber
Timber is the most commonly used natural building material and is incredibly versatile. It has widespread application beyond the timber frame of your build. It can also be used for cladding and joinery, as well as for all kinds of internal finishes and flooring. It’s durable, structurally strong and surprisingly fire resistant. Timber can sustain very high temperatures without collapsing and is very effective for absorbing loud sounds – consider this when building in densely populated areas.
Be sure to carefully specify the timber for your build as this will ensure it’s sustainably sourced from properly managed forests. To identify sustainably harvested timber, look for the FSC mark. When you need a surface finish, look for natural paints and stains made from plant-based resins, oils and dyes. These will biodegrade when disposed of, and little energy goes into their production.
Cob 
Cob is a mixture of sand, clay, and straw, bound together into a material which can be used to sculpt a home. Cob is pressed in such a way that there are no gaps or cracks, and it can be applied over a concrete or stone foundation.
Cob is virtually a zero-carbon home build, with the only emissions coming from the fuel for a digger. Cob walls are really thick, which means it’s not an ideal build method for a small plot, but it does result in a very thermally efficient home.
Straw bale
Straw is a by-product of agricultural production and of low value. What’s more, building with this material is quick and easy as well as having the added benefit of being fire-resistant. Straw can also be used as an infill material to work alongside a timber frame and provide highly efficient insulation.
Straw can be used in a similar way to bricks, or as a supportive material for the roof. It’s generally finished with lime render and lime or clay interior finishes, creating a breathable fabric that regulates indoor air quality and keeps damp at bay.
Cork 
Cork is a naturally occurring material that is sustainably produced, and is already used for many internal applications such as flooring, as well as eco-friendly cladding. Cork is also starting to be used as a building material for walls and roofs.
Hemp
Hemp is easy to grow, so can be used abundantly at a low cost. This material is generally used for walls, floors and roof structures. It’s also used to form hempcrete which is emerging as an eco-friendly alternative to traditional concrete. Hempcrete is made with fibres from fast-growing plants mixed with lime, resulting in a strong but lightweight alternative.
Reclaimed materials
There are lots of waste materials that are left unaccounted for within the construction industry, but these can in fact be reused for building projects.
Resources that come under this category include salvaged wood, materials from doors and windows, piping and chunks of concrete.
Lime
Lime is a durable material that can be used for plasters and renders. Unlike cement, it’s breathable and can be an effective finish or binder for other natural building materials. Old lime putty, plasters and renders can even be removed, soaked, remixed and reused.
Innovative sustainable building materials 
The UK needs to build 300,000 homes a year to meet government housebuilding targets but it also needs to do this with ‘net zero’ emissions targets in mind. Unsurprisingly, this is driving innovation in the eco-friendly building materials market.
Wood, for example, can now be treated and compressed to become transparent. This creates a strong and environmentally friendly alternative to glass and plastic, and has the strength of lumber but is much lighter. This method is also ideal for improving levels of light inside a property.
Discarded cigarettes are another interesting development. They account for a high volume of the UK’s waste each year, but researchers have found they lower the amount of time and energy required to bake bricks ready for construction. The cigarettes are added to the brick mixture before the baking process, resulting in a lighter material with better insulation properties.
These developments may sound insignificant, or even bizarre, but they are the types of small improvements needed to chip away at construction’s overall environmental impact.
Sustainable construction methods
Sustainable construction isn’t limited to just using eco materials. It also involves adopting better methods of working and some of these include:
Cutting materials carefully and precisely to reduce waste
Controlling waste management by separating and recycling waste
Constructing green buildings
Adaptive re-use projects, for example those that transform old buildings
Managing construction sites to improve the environment
Conserving energy
Selecting sustainable and recycled materials
FAQs
What are sustainable building materials in construction?
The use of natural, renewable, low-carbon materials for buildings. These include natural fibres and abundant mineral resources. For example, straw, timber, cork and cob are used as structural fabric, insulation and finishes in buildings, both in retrofit and new build.
What building materials are most sustainable?
Timber is often regarded as the most sustainable building material within the construction industry. Possessing a low-carbon footprint, it can be used as a replacement for steel and, in some cases, concrete.

In This Blog: Painting in cold weather Interior house painting in winter Exterior painting in the winter (UK) FAQs Painting in cold weather doesn’t sound like most people’s idea of fun. However, the need to spruce up your walls can’t always wait for perfect weather conditions. So, we’re here to tell you everything you need to about hiring a professional to paint in the winter, DIY painting in the winter, how to prepare, and the best methods to use. It’s worth mentioning that wet weather and exterior painting don’t go hand in hand unless you have a tarpaulin or some other way to keep your paint free from the elements while it dries.
Indoor painting is fine as long as the temperature stays between 10 and 30 degrees Celsius and you keep good air circulation. This includes opening windows and doors or purchasing a fan/blow heater – all of which can be hired from your local hardware store. Painting in cold weather Before you get started, consider pricing up your project using the following cost guides: Cost to render a wall Painter and decorator prices Painting in cold weather is trickier than other types of painting projects. That’s why it’s always worth  hiring a professional  if you’re unsure of your DIY prowess. Not only does a professional ensure your project is completed to a high standard, but they also save you extra potential costs caused by poor craftmanship further down the line.

Tools you’ll need for the job
If you still want to try it alone then here’s what you’ll need before you do anything:
Thermometer
Cold weather paint
Stiff brushes
Infrared thermometer for surface temperatures Interior house painting in winter Although it’s good practice to paint in more temperate climes, it can’t always be helped. Consequently, homeowners are forced to paint in temperatures below 10 degrees Celcius. Thankfully, there are several tips and tricks when it comes to painting in these adverse conditions.
Painting when it’s colder than 10 degrees outside causes various negative effects on both the paint itself and the application. For example, alkyd and oil-based paints thicken in lower temperatures, making them harder to apply, while water-based paints or those labelled as ‘latex’ are susceptible to freezing.
To stop the issue of freezing, simply add a ‘freeze-resistant paint additive’ to the water-based paint, which will help somewhat. It’s worth noting that if you don’t cure your paint in the right conditions, it can lead to issues further down the line. These include peeling, bubbling, cracking, colour inconsistency, and poor coverage.
Top tip:
 Previously frozen paint is likely unusable. However, oil-based paints resist freezing damage far better. If your paint is lumpy after you’ve defrosted it, it won’t emulsify or cure properly, so it’s best to throw it out. Exterior painting in the winter (UK) When it comes to painting exterior render, cold weather impacts the drying time of most paint types. This includes recoats, which need longer to cure before you add another layer.
If you’ve managed to protect the wall you’re painting using tarpaulin, note that for temperatures below 10 degrees celsius, you’ll need to factor in the extra time it takes to dry. For example, with some alkyd or oil-based paints, you might need to wait 48 hours before applying your second coat.
Another thing to take into consideration when painting outside in winter is the variation in temperatures on different structures. Direct sunlight and shade will impact the drying and subsequent recoat times of your painting project.
Ideal cold-weather paints
Buying a specialised paint that’s specifically formulated for painting in winter is ideal. Many of these brands recommend painting in temperatures no lower than 1-degree Celsius, so they’re perfect for most cold-weather projects. Also, the finish is more reliable than paints with added freeze-resistant additives or thinners. 
Top tip:
 The recommended weather temperature needs to remain either at or above that degree during the entire project. Therefore, check the weather forecast, including both day and night temperatures to ensure an even cure.
For external painting, the wind can make a huge difference to the surface temperate of your walls, which is worth monitoring before undertaking your painting project. One way to combat this is to purchase an infrared thermometer. This takes the guesswork out of your temperature measurements. Also, they’re relatively cheap and easy to pick up from your local DIY store.
Top tip:
 Because most paint thickens in low temperatures, apply it using a stiffer brush than you normally would. For example, those with nylon, polyester, or Chinex bristles. These all work well with thicker paint.
Protect the area
For external winter painting projects, the best way to ensure the greatest results is to protect the area. For this, you’ll need plastic sheeting/tarpaulin that’s supported on scaffolding or zip poles. To defend against the elements, enclose the area as tightly as possible and consider buying a space heater to increase the temperature inside your ‘bubble’ and therefore the drying times.
This setup comes with its own risks, so unless you’re 100% confident, we strongly recommend  hiring a professional . For example, the area needs to remain ventilated but the space heater needs to stay on throughout the curing and drying process.

Find the painters your neighbours rated  FAQs Best time to paint the exterior of your house (UK)?
The best time to paint the exterior of your house is weather dependant. Because of the UK’s notoriously fickle weather patterns, finding the perfect week to paint your exterior is a matter of research and good luck. Ultimately, a mild few days that aren’t too hot or cold are ideal. For example, a dry April weekend or a mild October week.
What temperature can you paint outside?
The minimum temperature to paint outside (UK) is 1-degree Celcius. However, these conditions will almost always require a bubble of some sort to ensure your paint cures and dries properly. However, try to apply your paint when both the surface and air temperatures are above 5-degrees Celcius or 10 and above for primers.

Granite vs concrete countertops cost,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/granite-vs-concrete-countertops-cost/,Kitchen,"Granite vs concrete countertops cost

In This Blog: Granite countertops cost Concrete countertop cost Granite vs concrete countertops cost Granite vs concrete countertops – pros and cons FAQs about the cost of granite and concrete countertops Choosing your kitchen countertop is a big decision, it will cover a large area of your kitchen and be at the centre of your room’s look and feel for years to come. Granite is a timeless, trusted choice, but more recently concrete has gained in popularity as people seek a more minimalist, industrial look.
In this guide we’ll look at 
granite vs concrete countertops cost
, including the installation cost too.
Project requirements
Cost + VAT (Range low - high)
Average cost
Granite countertop (3m2 installed)
£950 - £1,400
£1,175
Concrete countertop (3m2 installed)
£950 - £1,700
£1,325
Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Granite countertops cost One of the big attractions of granite countertops, aside from their resilience, is the fact that they come in many colours and variations. From natural white with brown or grey seams, to midnight black with gold leaf, you really can achieve a unique look in your kitchen using a granite countertop.
This variety is great at the design stage, but when it comes to costing it, it’s difficult to determine an exact price for your individual kitchen project. Typically, a granite countertop fully installed by a kitchen fitter in the UK will cost on average between 
£950 – £1,400 for a 3m2 section
. This also includes the removal of your old worktop. If you’re particularly DIY savvy, you might look to  cut and install a granite worktop  yourself.
Remember that the price of your granite worktop could be more if you opt for gold leaf. Or cost less, if you go for a standard granite design. Concrete countertop cost Look through any kitchen design magazine, Instagram account or Pinterest board and you’ll see plenty of polished concrete. It has increased in popularity of late due to a rising demand for minimalist, luxury kitchen designs that echo industrial environments.
Although it may seem like concrete countertops come only in grey, they can be tinted in a number of colours and finished to a variety of specifications, making general costing difficult.
For a kitchen project in the UK, you can expect to pay on average between 
£950 – £1,700 for a 3m2 section
 of concrete countertop fully installed by a kitchen fitter. Again, this includes the removal of your old worktop.

Find worktop experts your neighbours rated  Granite vs concrete countertops cost As you can see, the average granite vs concrete countertops cost including installation is quite similar, with concrete coming out slightly more expensive. However, with the price difference so small, it really does come down to how much you need and what style will best suit your vision for your kitchen. Granite vs concrete countertops – pros and cons When weighing up the cost of either granite or concrete countertops for your new kitchen, it can be useful to understand the pros and cons of each material.
Granite
Pros:
Granite is a natural stone, so if that’s important to you, then it’s the clear choice when compared with manmade concrete.
Granite is actually easy to repair, with DIY fixes possible on small chips.
It is also more resistant to heat than concrete, which is an important consideration in a kitchen.
A granite countertop requires less maintenance than a concrete countertop.
Cons:
Sometimes granite samples can be different to the actual worktops you receive.
Granite requires resealing every year, which can be done by a professional.
When to comes to the long-term look, granite is slightly porous, which can result in staining if particularly vivid foods and liquids aren’t cleaned up quickly.
Also, granite countertops typically have a larger carbon footprint than concrete countertops due to the work required to extract the stone, process it, and deliver it. This is particularly significant if an alternative concrete worktop is made from recycled materials.
Concrete
Pros:
Despite appearing to only be one shade of grey, there are in fact fifty shades or more you can choose from.
You can have patterns created in your concrete during the casting stage.
Concrete is incredibly hard and is almost impossible to scratch.
Unlike granite, which is limited by its natural 
occurrence
, concrete is available in any 
shape
 or size, 
giving
 you 
unlimited
 kitchen design possibilities.
If you love being green, your concrete countertops can be made from recycled concrete, which reduces your carbon footprint and can add character.
Cons:
Concrete countertops need to be made, unlike granite where Mother Nature does the making, which can mean a time-consuming casting and curing process.
While they are highly scratch-resistant
, concrete countertops do need more maintenance to keep them looking polished and pristine.
Concrete is tough, but it can crack over time as the bonds created during casting weaken.
Making new concrete requires a lot of energy to mix, bond and heat the ingredients, which has a carbon cost. FAQs about the cost of granite and concrete countertops Are concrete countertops cheaper than granite?
No. As you can see in the costs detailed above, on average you’ll pay more for concrete countertops vs granite countertops.
Of course, it could be that your specific concrete countertop is relatively low cost, the best way to know is to get quotes from kitchen countertop specialists.
Are concrete countertops more expensive than granite?
Yes. On average you’ll pay more for concrete countertops vs granite countertops, typically up to 
£300
more 
at the high-quality end.
As always, the best way to get an idea of the cost of your new kitchen countertops is to get quotes from local professionals. It’s easy to do this, simply enter your postcode in the free search tool below to get started.

Floor plans
Ceiling plans
Roof plans
Cross-sections
External elevations
Site plans
Once the building has been surveyed, drawings and/or a 3D model can be created.

An  architect ,  structural engineer , developer, or designer can use the survey to plan and design refurbishments, redevelopments, or extensions.
A property developer can use them when planning the renovation or conversion of their domestic and commercial buildings.
A landlord can use the survey to assist with space planning or lease plans when determining the lettable areas of a property.
On the whole, a measured building survey will help to make sure new layouts, room sizes, fire protection systems, and materials can be planned confidently while avoiding costly mistakes.

Are chimneys a landlord’s responsibility?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/chimney-landlords-responsibility/,Living Room,"Are chimneys a landlord’s responsibility?

In This Blog: Chimney landlord responsibility Landlord responsibility for ventilation Landlord responsibility for chimney sweeping A cosy fire is one of life’s simplest but greatest pleasures that have been a part of homes for the most part of history. They do require regular maintenance for safety purposes. But what about in rented properties? In this guide, we take a look at what a landlord’s responsibility is when it comes to chimneys and ventilation. Chimney landlord responsibility As a landlord, you are responsible for fire safety in your rental property. Under  Section 11 of The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 , a landlord is legally responsible for ‘
ensuring the safety, working and servicing of all heating and hot water installations
‘. From this explanation, it is not immediately clear, but this does include open fires, Rayburn stoves, gas, coal, and wood-burning stoves.
If your rental property has an open fire, a wood-burning stove or the appliances mentioned then your landlord responsibilities are:
To follow fire safety regulations
To provide a  smoke alarm  on each storey and a carbon monoxide alarm in any room with a solid fuel-burning appliance (a coal fire or wood-burning stove)
To check your tenants have clear access to escape routes at all times
To ensure the furniture and furnishings you provide are fire safe
To provide fire alarms and extinguishers if the property is a large house in multiple occupations (HMO)
Fuel-burning and fires can pose a number of risks and health concerns for tenants, so it is vitally important to pay particular attention to these landlord responsibilities for chimneys.

Find recommended chimney sweeps near you  Landlord responsibility for ventilation Hand in hand with the responsibility for chimneys is the responsibility for ventilation.
The main concern in regards to ventilation is the health of the tenants. If your property has a fire, gas appliances or a fuel-burning stove, then as a landlord you have the responsibility to make sure that these items are serviced annually. You must also ensure that any flues are also maintained to provide the  proper ventilation .
A landlord’s responsibility for ventilation extends beyond fires and chimneys. One of the other potential areas for concern is mould and damp.
Landlords cannot put their tenants’ health at risk and so to help alleviate mould and damp you must try to put in as many condensation-management features as possible. If these can be automated then all the better. Examples of this would be installing a  mechanical ventilation and heat recovery system  (MVHR) or the use of  dehumidifiers .
A landlord also has the responsibility of educating the tenants on what they can do to avoid problems such as condensation that leads to damp. You should advise them to regularly open windows to let damp or humid air out of bathrooms and kitchens, and not to leave wet washing hanging up for too long. To help protect tenants and your property, you could consider adding a contractual requirement for your tenants to regularly ventilate the property. If you are considering adding any clauses into your tenancy agreement it is always recommended to seek legal advice before doing so. Landlord responsibility for chimney sweeping If your rental property has an open fire or wood-burning stove with a chimney, there are specific landlord responsibilities for  chimney sweeping . Before the start of a tenancy, as a landlord, you must make sure that chimneys and flues are swept and not blocked by any obstructions. The easiest way to keep on top of this is to  find a recommended local chimney sweep  and book in for periodic servicing and appointments to make sure any chimneys in your rental property are safe.
As part of your tenancy agreement, you can pass the responsibility for getting the chimney swept and in a safe and usable condition on to your tenants. However, it is highly recommended that as the landlord you take the responsibility for  chimney sweeping and maintenance .
As well as being important for general health and safety, chimney sweeping is also important for your insurance. Some underwriters make it very clear in their policies that in order to be adequately insured, chimneys and flues need to be regularly maintained. As the landlord, if you fail to ensure this happens, in the event of a chimney fire you may find that your policy may be invalid.
Chimneys should be swept at least once a year as a minimum and should always be swept before the colder months. Chimney sweeps provide a certificate to show that the necessary work has been completed so you should always keep an up-to-date record of when your chimney was swept.
Being a landlord comes with a lot of responsibilities. If you are unsure how best to look after your chimney, Aga or wood-burning stove then always seek the  advice of a professional .

Landlord responsibilities for common areas,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/landlord-responsibility-common-areas/,Garden,"Landlord responsibilities for common areas

In This Blog: Landlord responsibilities for common areas Landlord responsibility for a communal entrance door Landlord regulations for the stairs and hallway Landlord garden responsibilities Landlord fence responsibilities What to do if a landlord is not taking responsibility for communal areas FAQs Many tenanted properties have communal areas, such as the entrance door, hallway, stairs, and garden. But who’s responsible for the maintenance and repair of these shared spaces?
In this post, with support from the  British Landlord Association , we’ll outline the landlord’s responsibility for common areas, and what aspects fall to the tenant. Landlord responsibilities for common areas The tenancy agreement will usually state who’s responsible for the maintenance and repair of communal areas. As a rule of thumb, a landlord is generally responsible, especially if the tenancy is an Assured shorthold for making necessary repairs to a rental property, and a tenant is responsible for maintaining it.
A tenant should only carry out repairs if this is outlined in the tenancy agreement.
A tenant cannot be forced to do repairs that are the landlord’s responsibility.
The cost of repairs that are a landlord’s responsibility cannot be passed on to the tenant.
The Defective Premises Act 1972
A landlord must keep a tenanted property safe and free from hazards.
The Defective Premises Act 1972 sets out the duties of care a landlord owes a tenant. Landlords have a duty of care to prevent personal injury (to the tenants, their families, and visitors) or damage to property caused by defects in the property.
The duty is owed where the landlord is under an obligation to repair or maintain the rented property (or has a right to enter the property to carry out maintenance or repairs). The duty of care under this act is owed if the landlord knows, or should have known, about the repair.
This often relates to common areas, as the landlord controls this part of the building, i.e. they should be able to identify repairs themselves, without the tenant informing them. Landlord responsibility for a communal entrance door So what’s a landlord’s legal responsibility for the communal entrance door of a tenanted property?
Well, when it comes to the communal entrance door, a landlord is responsible for:
The repair of defective external doors, saddles, and door frames.
Hinges, locks, handles, trapper bars, and letterboxes on external doors.
The door entry system to a communal entrance.
The tenant should contact the landlord or letting agent as soon as a problem is identified to ensure the property is safe and secure. Landlord regulations for the stairs and hallway A landlord’s responsibility for the stairs and hallway includes: 
Walls, staircases, and all structural timbers.
Architraves, skirting boards, timber sills, and other internal decorative woodwork.
Floor tiling.
Any airbricks and ventilators.
Any electrical wiring in the hallway, socket outlets, and switches.
Ceiling roses, lamp holders, and flexes.
A landlord must also follow fire safety regulations. This includes smoke alarms, access to escape routes, and fire alarms and extinguishers if the property is a large  house in multiple occupation (HMO) .
The law implies a condition into every tenancy agreement that the tenant must use their home in a ‘tenant-like’ way. This includes the tenant (and their visitors) not causing any damage to the property. If a tenant does cause damage to the communal areas, the landlord should be notified immediately so the necessary repairs and associated costs can be discussed.

Find a property maintenance specialist in your area  Landlord garden responsibilities When it comes to the garden, a landlord is responsible for the tasks that would be unreasonable for the tenant to do themselves. Typically, this includes  hedge trimming , tree maintenance, and  pruning shrubs .
As long as they were installed by the landlord, the landlord is responsible for repairs to:
Garden paths Walls Gates The tenant is responsible for general maintenance, i.e. jobs that need to be done regularly. This normally includes tasks such as cleaning,  lawn mowing , weeding, and sweeping.
Our post on  landlord garden maintenance  covers this area in more detail. It also explains what to do in the event of a dispute over landlord or tenant garden responsibility. Landlord fence responsibilities The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and the Housing Act 2004 both define the responsibility for the repair and maintenance of the structure and interior of a property as being down to the landlord. This includes the exterior of the property, not forgetting the fences.
A landlord is responsible for the fences in a tenanted property 
that they have installed
. They are also responsible for the  cost of repair or replacement of fences  that have been damaged by natural forces, e.g. a storm or flood.
A tenant is responsible for the cost of repair to fencing if:
The tenant has installed the fencing.
The tenant has caused damage to the fencing that the landlord has installed.
The fencing has been damaged due to the tenant’s negligence or anything that breaches the terms of the tenancy agreement.
If a landlord needs to carry out repair work to a communal area, such as the garden, they do not have to inform the tenant. What to do if a landlord is not taking responsibility for communal areas If a landlord fails to make the necessary repairs to their tenanted property, the tenant should contact the environmental health department at the  local council . In Scotland, contact the  Private Rented Housing Panel (PRHP) .
If the rented property is unsafe or unfit for human habitation, a tenant should ask for the housing department at the local council. They will do a  Housing Health and Safety Rating System assessment  and will take action if they deem your home to have serious health and safety hazards. There are different procedures for tenants in  Scotland  and  Northern Ireland .
Our post on  property maintenance costs  will help landlords budget for some of the most common maintenance jobs. To find a property maintenance specialist in your local area, use our search function below.

Find a property maintenance specialist in your area  FAQs What regulations are there for stairs?
A landlord should make sure that the treads, risers, nosings, balustrades, and handrails are complete and in good condition. Ideally, the stairs should be at least 900mm wide to allow an adult and child to use the stairs side-by-side in the event of an emergency. There should be good lighting (and switches for lighting) at the top and bottom of the stairs. In an HMO property, landlords are responsible for the stair covering and making sure the stairs are not obstructed.
What is a landlord’s legal responsibility for a communal entrance door?
A landlord’s legal responsibility for a communal entrance door includes the door itself and any hardware – hinges, locks, handles, trapper bars, and letterboxes. The landlord’s responsibility also extends to the door entry system to a communal entrance.
Can a tenant sue a landlord for falling down the stairs?
This is not a clear-cut ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. Should a tenant fall down the stairs of their tenanted property, many aspects would be considered, including whether there were any defects to the stairs, and whether the landlord had been informed of those defects.

Landlord rights,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/landlord-rights/,Tag Not Found,"Landlord rights

In This Blog: Landlord eviction rights A landlords right to terminate a lease Landlord access rights Landlord rights and coronavirus A Landlords right to increase rent A landlords right to sell property with tenants FAQs Do you know your rights as a landlord? Whether you’re thinking of becoming a landlord for the first time, or if you simply need a reminder, we’re taking a look at some of the legal rights of a landlord in England and Wales. This article has been reviewed and contributions made by experts at   The British Landlords Association. Landlord eviction rights As a landlord, hopefully, you will never have to end a tenancy through eviction, but should you need to, these are your rights as a landlord. You have two main options if you need to evict your tenants You can use either: Section 21  – This is where you can take back possession of your property after a fixed-term tenancy agreement ends or a break clause is due. In this case, there is usually no wrongdoing on the tenants’ part.
Section 8 – This is for when you need to evict a tenant for serious issues such as non-payment of rent, causing a nuisance, or damage to your property. This is typically what you think of when you think of eviction.
Landlords can use Section 21 for a variety of reasons, including their wish to move into the property themselves or to sell their property without the extra complication of having a tenant living there. Under your rights as a landlord, you can also use Section 21 if you are concerned about your tenants’ ability to pay the rent or if they are in arrears with their payments to you.
As a landlord, you do need to be aware that some tenancies can only be ended for a legal reason, commonly known as ‘grounds’. Landlords must prove a legal ground in court to get an eviction order. Some of the common grounds for eviction are rent arrears or nuisance or antisocial behaviour. Some grounds are classed as mandatory, which means the court must order tenants to leave if the landlord can prove the ground. Other grounds are discretionary which means the court may decide to let tenants stay even if the landlord can prove the ground.
When drawing up a tenancy agreement it is always important to get the advice of a legal professional and pay careful attention to the law, especially around the topic of what can end a tenancy agreement. A landlords right to terminate a lease If you find yourself in the position of needing to terminate your tenant’s lease, you must give them notice in a particular way, including certain information and warnings. The information and notice you need to give will depend on the type of tenancy agreement and its terms.
Assured shorthold tenancy
As a landlord, you can take back possession of your property if you have a periodic tenancy or a fixed-term tenancy that has ended. You must give written notice to your tenants and the amount of notice you need to give them will depend on when you have served, or intend to serve the notice to quit. The notice periods are as follows:
Two months if they gave you notice before 26 March 2020
Three months if they gave you notice between 26 March 2020 and 28 August 2020
Six months if they gave you notice between 29 August 2020 and 31 May 2021
Four months if they gave you notice between 1 June 2021 and 30 September 2021
Two months if they gave you notice on or after 1 October 2021 in England and six months in Wales
In England, you must give at least two months notice.
Fixed-term tenancy
If you have a fixed-term tenancy agreement, your landlord right to terminate their lease means that you can only ask your tenants to leave on certain grounds including if the tenant is behind with rent payments, they are using the property for illegal practises, or they have damaged the property.
If you’re using a Section 8 notice to terminate the lease, depending on the reason for eviction, your tenants may need to leave sooner than the two months notice period. With a fixed-term tenancy, if your tenants are behind in rent payments of up to four months (also known as ‘non-serious’ arrears) you must give them two months to leave the property.
Excluded tenancies or licenses
If your tenant is living as a lodger then if you intend to terminate the lease, you need to give them a notice period which is as long as their rental payment period, which is usually monthly. In the case of a tenant who is a lodger, you do not need to give them notice in writing.
Non excluded licence or tenancy
With this type of agreement, you can terminate the lease at any time with a notice to quit and give four weeks notice.
Break clauses
If you wish to end a fixed-term tenancy agreement but have a break clause, as a landlord you cannot issue a notice to quit during the fixed term unless under specific grounds. The next time you would be able to end the lease would be after the fixed term.
As you can see there are many different legal requirements when it comes to terminating a lease agreement, which is why it is so important to seek the advice of a legal professional. As a landlord, it is always important to be clear in the terms of your tenancy agreements.

Find a recommended removals company  Landlord access rights There may be occasions as a landlord when you will need to gain access to your rental property when your tenants are living there. Although as the landlord you own the property, you must get the tenant’s consent before visiting. If a landlord or anyone acting on the landlord’s behalf enters the property without prior tenant’s consent, this is trespassing and will be in breach of the tenancy agreement.
Once a tenant has moved in, as a landlord you should give at least 24 hours written notice before visiting the rental property and a text message or email is sufficient. The notice should include the time and date of the visit and who will be visiting the property, and why. Your tenants have the right to ‘quiet enjoyment’ which is a broad and general term, that essentially means that your tenants are obliged to be given their privacy. Any clause in a tenancy agreement that permits a landlord to visit the property whenever they like, without notice or permission, would be seen by law as an unfair term and considered void if there was any dispute.
A landlord does have very specific rights which give them legitimate access to the property. Section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 states that a landlord has an obligation to maintain and repair:
The structure and exterior of the property (including drains,  gutters  and external pipes),
The installations in the property for the supply of water, gas and electricity and for sanitation, and
The installations in the property for space heating and heating water.
A landlord, or someone instructed by the landlord, like a plumber or gas engineer, will need access to the property to carry out these repairs.
In addition to access for repairs, a landlord also has a right to view the condition of a property. A landlord or someone acting as their agent, from a letting agency for example can gain access to the property at a “reasonable time of the day” but only after giving the tenant a minimum of 24 hours notice in writing. During the tenancy, as a landlord, you may wish to visit the property to conduct a mid-term inspection and again, 24 hours notice is required to be given to your tenants.
There are times when it is acceptable for a landlord to access the property without prior notice and these are emergency scenarios such as:
A fire in the property
Structural damage that requires urgent attention
Water flowing from the building
A strong smell of gas
Suspicion of a violent or criminal incident
A serious concern for welfare
In any of these cases, as a landlord, you must behave ‘reasonably’ and obtain photographic evidence of any issues that are evident and get signed inspections from contractors that you have employed to remedy the situation. Landlord rights and coronavirus Due to the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020,  The Coronavirus Act 2020  was brought in. This gave tenants extra protection and in the case of ending tenancy agreements, increased the notice period to four months, except in cases such as serious rent arrears or anti-social behaviour. From 1st October 2021, the notice period has been reduced to the pre-pandemic position.
Under The Coronavirus Act 2020, rent is still legally due but if tenants are having difficulty paying their rent due to their employment situation then it advises that they should speak to their landlord at the earliest opportunity. To help assist with this unprecedented situation, the government has worked with the National Residential Landlords Association to produce  a guide to managing arrears and avoiding possession claims  in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.
Ending a tenancy early due to the pandemic
The coronavirus pandemic has affected everybody differently, and landlords have also felt the impact. If a tenant wishes to end the tenancy early due to the pandemic, as a landlord you can charge a fee but this fee must not be greater than the loss that you as the landlord would incur from loss of the rental income or associated costs including the use of a letting agent. The government’s guidance on the  Tenant Fees Act  contains more information.
Landlord repairs and maintenance during the pandemic
Any repairs or maintenance work should be carried out as per the tenancy agreement but in accordance with the  working safely guidance . For more information and advice see the  Covid 19 renting guidance for landlords and tenants .

Find a recommended removals company  A Landlords right to increase rent During your time as a landlord, you may need to or wish to increase the rent that your tenants pay you. The tenancy agreement you have with your tenants should include how and when the rent will be reviewed. For a periodic tenancy (rolling on a week-by-week or month-by-month basis) as a landlord, you cannot usually increase the rent more than once a year. For a fixed-term tenancy (running for a set period) you can only increase the rent if your tenants agree. If they don’t, the rent can only be increased when the fixed term comes to an end.
When you do increase the rent, any rise in payment must be fair and realistic and should be in line with average local rents in the area and for the type of property.  As part of a landlords right to increase the rent you can:
Renew your tenancy agreement at the end of the fixed term, but with an increased rent
Agree to a rent increase with tenants and produce a written record of the agreement that you both sign
Use a ‘Landlord’s notice proposing a new rent’ form Section 13 notice, which increases the rent after the fixed term has ended
As a landlord, to increase the rent you must give a minimum of one month’s notice if the rent is paid weekly or monthly. If there is a yearly tenancy, then you must give six months notice to increase the rent.
For more info see the  Gov.UK guidance on rent increases . A landlords right to sell property with tenants There may come a time that you wish to sell your rental property, so what are your landlord rights to sell a property when you have tenants? The good news is you can sell your property when you still have tenants, and there are two options. You can either sell the property with the tenancy or terminate the tenancy and complete the sale after the property is vacant.
Selling with the tenancy
 – With this option, you will sell your property with your tenant(s) remaining as residents, subject to the existing tenancy. This means your tenant(s) will remain in the property after the sale is completed, and they will then start paying rent to the new owner and the property will be kept as a buy to let.
Completing the sale after possession (i.e. eviction)
 – In this case, you would need to end the tenancy before the sale is completed, so the property is vacant upon completion. This can be more complicated as you may lose income whilst you wait for your tenants to vacate. It can also be harder to organise viewings with your tenants as you will need to give them notice. You may also experience issues with the condition of the property if you are trying to sell whilst your tenants are still in residence.
Being a landlord means you have a number of responsibilities and there are a lot of rules and regulations to keep track of. If you are unsure about anything with regards to your tenancy agreements, always seek the advice of a professional before taking action. FAQs Does a landlord have the right to change the locks?
It is illegal for a landlord to change the locks without permission unless it is an emergency or if the tenants are lodgers and live in the same property as the landlord.

How to become an HMO landlord,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/how-to-become-hmo-landlord/,Tag Not Found,"How to become an HMO landlord

In This Blog: What is an HMO? HMO requirements HMO license cost HMO council tax HMO mortgage HMO expenses HMO management regulations HMO fire regulations HMO minimum room size HMO planning permission HMO insurance HMO inspection FAQs If you’ve ever wondered how to become an HMO landlord and what the HMO landlord responsibilities are, then this guide is for you. We’ve created a complete overview with support from the  British Landlord Association . What is an HMO? An HMO is also known as 
Houses of Multiple Occupation
. A  student house  or a house share is the perfect example. The definition of an HMO is a property where three or more unrelated people live there as at least two separate households – for example, three single people with their own rooms, or two couples each sharing their own room.
To be classed as an HMO, the property has to meet certain HMO requirements which we’ll cover in more detail in the guide below. One of the defining features of an HMO is that all occupants share basic amenities, such as a kitchen or bathroom.
In a situation where five or more tenants from the same household live together in a rented property, this is classed as a large HMO. Hostels and B&Bs that are not just for holidays and leisure use can also be licensed as an HMO. HMO requirements If you’re considering becoming an HMO landlord, you should contact your local authority to find out what license is required. There are some basic and some quite specific HMO requirements which are:
The house must be suitable for the number of tenants, meaning it should be of the appropriate size and have enough of the right facilities.
As the manager of the house (you or an agent) must not have a criminal record and must not be in breach of landlord laws or the code of practice.
To display information and guidance in the common areas.
In accordance with the Housing Act 2004, to be defined as an HMO, the building must fall within one of the following categories:
A building or flat in which more than one household shares a basic amenity, such as bathrooms, toilets, or cooking facilities. This is known as the ‘standard test’ or the ‘self-contained flat test’.
A building that has been converted and does not just comprise of self-contained flats: this is known as the ‘converted building test’.
A building that is declared as an HMO by the local authority.
A converted block of flats where the standard of the conversion does not meet the relevant building standards and fewer than two-thirds of the flats are owner-occupied: this is known as a section 257 HMO.
Once obtained, an HMO license is valid for a maximum of five years and if you have multiple HMO properties, you will need a separate license for each.

Find landlord inventory specialists near you  HMO license cost HMO landlords that operate without a license risk an unlimited fine. Aside from the financial implications, obtaining an HMO license is also important for safety reasons.
There are two main categories of licensing. The first category is for a small HMO, where at least three people who are not from the same household live together and share facilities. In this scenario, you may not need an HMO license but you should check with your local council as the regulations vary dependant on your location. The cost of this license will also vary.
Your local council can implement a ‘selective’ licensing scheme for HMO properties that are not subject to mandatory licensing. This can include properties in certain geographical areas, such as student houses close to universities, and also blocks converted into self-contained flats.
For HMOs where five or more people share facilities and form more than one household to form a ‘large HMO’ a license is mandatory. Local councils decide their own fee for how much to charge for mandatory HMO licenses, so the cost will vary according to your location. HMO license fees should not be excessive as they should only cover the cost of running the licensing scheme.
When you want to submit an HMO license application, you will need Gas Safety and Electrical safety certificates for the property, as well as the floor plan of the property. You can apply for a license on the  government website . If you submit an application for an HMO license and your HMO license application is turned down, your application fee will be refunded to you. HMO council tax If you’re considering becoming an HMO landlord then you may be wondering who is responsible for paying the council tax? This ultimately depends on how your HMO set up fits within the  Regulation 2 Council Tax (Liability for Owners) Regulations 1992 .
If you let your rooms as bedsits or operate using license agreements (this is less common) then you as the landlord are responsible for paying the council tax. If you have a contract or tenancy agreement where a group of tenants shares the property together then the tenant is responsible.
The tenant is also responsible if your HMO rooms are let on a room-by-room basis where each room has its own council tax band. In this situation, each room is classed as its own separate dwelling, and therefore each tenant is responsible for paying their own council tax.
To make sure all parties understand, it is worthwhile having a clause in your tenancy agreement to say who is responsible for the council tax. HMO mortgage If you plan to run an HMO and you require a mortgage, specialist buy-to-let mortgages have some key differences:
HMO mortgages are usually linked to rates like LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) rather than the Bank of England base rate.
To be successfully offered a buy-to-let mortgage, landlords have to prove their experience of borrowing before taking one out
Maximum loan to value (LTV) is typically between 60-75%
HMO mortgages can be more expensive than typical mortgages due to the LIBOR rate and additional fees. This is something to bear in mind if you plan to become an HMO landlord as it can eat into your profits.
For more information, take a look at our  buy-to-let guide for landlords . HMO expenses As an HMO landlord, you will of course have to pay the usual landlord expenses such as property upkeep and maintenance, utility bills and letting agent fees if you use a letting agent.
Additional HMO expenses are the cost of the license and any associated legal fees that may be required to successfully become an HMO landlord.

Find landlord inventory specialists near you  HMO management regulations HMO landlords are also required to meet certain HMO management regulations. These include:
Ensuring appropriate  fire safety measures  are in place, including working  smoke alarms .
Ensuring annual  gas safety checks  are carried out. Checking the electrics  every five years.
Supplying enough cooking and bathroom facilities for the number of tenants living there.
Providing communal areas and shared facilities that are  clean and in good repair .
Making sure the structure and exterior of the house are safe and in a good state of repair, including the walls, window frames, and gutters.
Supplying enough rubbish bins to safely dispose of household waste.
Keeping the gas and water pipes in good working order and serviced regularly.
Maintain and service any fixed heaters (such as radiators) and water heaters.
Ensure the property is not overcrowded. HMO fire regulations In addition to the regulations above, HMO landlords also have to comply with the following fire regulations.
As an HMO landlord you must:
Install and maintain  smoke detectors and alarms Send the council an updated  gas safety certificate  each year
Provide safety certificates for all electrical appliances each year or upon request.
Most newer homes now have smoke alarms that have a mains powered back up which offers a higher level of safety and protection. If your smoke alarms are battery-powered you must make sure to check and test them regularly.
When getting your gas appliances and electrical appliances serviced, you must ensure that you use tradespeople who possess the correct qualifications and accreditations –  such as a gas safe registered heating engineer to service your boiler. HMO minimum room size Part of the HMO management regulations relate to providing enough space for people to live comfortably and safely.
If you plan to become an HMO landlord then you need to ensure that your tenants’ rooms comply with the minimum room sizes below. Your local council may have individual standards so if you are applying for an HMO license you should check before making your application.
6.51 square metres for a person aged 10 or over
10.22 square metres for two people aged 10 or over
4.64 square metres for a child under 10 years old HMO planning permission If you are looking to turn an existing property into an HMO, the existing ‘use class’ will influence whether or not you need planning permission. The main use classes for residential properties are C3 for a primary or secondary dwelling, C4 for an HMO, and Sui Generis for a large HMO.
HMO regulations are always changing so it is important to seek professional advice before beginning any work. HMO insurance As an HMO landlord, you will also need a specialist HMO insurance policy – a standard landlord insurance policy does not provide adequate cover. HMO insurance policies provide public liability insurance as well as building and contents cover.
When looking for HMO insurance you need o look for a policy that is appropriate for the type of HMO license that you hold e.g. a standard HMO or a large HMO. If you have more than one HMO property it may be possible to add multiple locations to one HMO insurance policy, so shop around when looking for quotes.
The total cost of your HMO insurance will depend on the location, type, and size of your property, as well as the number of tenants and number of households living together. Larger houses in a city with more than two households will have a higher premium as they will be seen as more likely to present a risk. HMO inspection In the same way that any landlord would carry out an inspection of their property, an HMO landlord is also required to do the same. Under the Housing, Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS), HMOs are required to have an inspection.
As HMO properties are also considered to be a higher risk, they are also subject to additional regulations to protect the tenants. These include Management of HMO Regulations 2006 and 2007 and Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.
There is a formal list of 29 hazards that an HMO landlord should be checking for in their HMO property that fall under these categories:
Dampness or excess of cold or heat
Pollutants such as asbestos, carbon monoxide, or lead
Lack of space, security or lighting, or exposure to excessive noise
Poor hygiene, lack of and condition of sanitation, sufficient clean water supply
Accidents that could be caused by falls, electric shocks, fires, burns, scalds
Risk of collisions, explosions, or structural collapse FAQs How do you get an HMO license?
To get an HMO license you will need to apply on the  gov.uk website . You will need to have specific paperwork about your property in order to apply.

Gas vs electric heat cost – which is cheaper?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/gas-vs-electric-heat-cost-which-is-cheaper/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Gas vs electric heat cost – which is cheaper?

In This Blog: Cost comparison between gas and electric heating Gas vs electric heat cost FAQs When comparing gas vs electric heat cost, you’re probably keen to know which is cheaper.
On the face of it, gas is cheaper than electric if you’re simply comparing the unit cost (in this case, the cost per kWh). Gas costs 
4.65p/kWh
 and electric costs 
16p/kWh
.
However, while cost per unit is a really important element to consider, there are many other things to weigh up before deciding which type of heating is right for you.
Please note that the UK wholesale energy market is currently in crisis with the current global surge in demand. The energy price cap has already risen by more than 50% and will potentially rise again later this year. 
As such, it is not possible to accurately estimate the cost of energy usage at this time (February 2022). However, we will keep this cost guide updated and estimate the costs again once the market has settled (prices last edited December 2021).

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Cost comparison between gas and electric heating Our table of costs allows you to calculate the cost of gas heating and electric heating per kWh, plus the average installation cost for each type of system.
The unit cost of gas heating is cheaper than electric, at 
4.65p/kWh
, vs 
16p/kWh for electricity
.
However, the average  cost to install a gas central heating system  is around 
£5,250
, compared with 
£3,790
 to install an electric heating system. Gas vs electric heat cost When comparing electric heat vs gas heat cost, you should factor in all the costs associated with each option to make an informed decision.
Unit cost
The unit cost is the cost of the actual fuel itself, be it gas or electric.
The unit cost of gas heating is 
4.65p/kWh. 
The unit cost of electricity is 
16p/kWh
.
Standing-charge
The standing-charge is a fixed daily amount you have to pay for energy regardless of how much you use. It covers the costs your energy supplier takes on in order to supply you with gas or electricity.
The cost of your standing charge will vary depending on your supplier and where you live. As a guide, you can expect to pay:
Electricity standing-charge: 
5p – 60p per day
Gas standing-charge: 
10p – 80p per day

See who your neighbours recommend for the job 
Cost of installation
If you’re switching from one type of energy to another, you’ll need to add in the cost of installing the components to facilitate the particular type of fuel.
For gas, you’ll need a boiler, pipework, and radiators. For electricity, you’ll need plug-in heaters or  storage heaters  in every room. You can have your  electric heaters hardwired to the mains by a professional electrician . It’s worth noting that due to the advances in electric fuel, more people are now choosing this as a means to heat their homes.
The cost of installation will vary depending on the size of your property and the complexity of the job, but on average:
To install a gas central heating system can cost around 
£5,250
To install an electric heating system can cost around 
£3,790

Thinking about gas heating?
 Then why not let us find you  central heating experts  that your neighbours have used and recommend.
Energy efficiency
As well as being carbon-neutral, another reason why electric has grown in popularity is its efficiency. Electric heating is 100% efficient – every watt of energy used by the heater is converted into heat.
Conversely, with gas central heating, up to 50% of the heat produced by a boiler can be lost through the pipes.
Heat management
With electric heating, you’ll often have thermostatic controls on each heater, meaning you can control which rooms you want to heat, reducing your heating costs. Smart electric heaters are controlled by an app, making this really quick and easy to do.
Gas central heating has a central control to which all the radiators are connected. Therefore you heat your entire home regardless of which rooms you’re using, which will cost more.
Maintenance
Once electric heaters are in place, there’s very little maintenance and they do not require servicing.
A gas central heating system, on the other hand, should be  serviced once a year.  Prices normally start at around 
£80
.
Lifespan
Electric heating systems are expected to last much longer than gas central heating systems. Some heaters even offer a lifetime guarantee.
A gas boiler will last around 15 years before it’ll need replacing, which carries a significant cost. A  boiler supply and installation  range from 
£2,000 – £4,000
.
The UK government is striving towards a carbon Net Zero target by 2050, which is something to consider if you’re deciding whether to choose gas or electric. It’s not beyond the realms of possibility that fossil fuel heating systems will be banned by 2025 in order to hit this milestone.

Gas heat is cheaper than electric (
4.65p/kWh
 vs 
16p/kWh 
respectively), however, there are other costs to consider in addition to the basic unit cost of the fuel. The cost of installation and the maintenance costs vary greatly between the two.
Is electric heating more expensive than gas?
Electric heating is more expensive than gas if you only compare the cost per unit of each type of fuel (gas is 
4.65p/kWh
, but electricity costs 
16p/kWh
). However, it is more expensive to install a gas central heating system (
£5,250
) than an electric heating system (
£3,790
).

How can I futureproof my plumbing and heating business for a low-carbon economy?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-can-i-futureproof-my-plumbing-and-heating-business-for-a-low-carbon-economy/,Tag Not Found,"How can I futureproof my plumbing and heating business for a low-carbon economy?

With net zero firmly on the agenda, the demand for low-carbon domestic heating continues to rise.
From 2025 onwards, gas boilers will no longer be installed in new homes, while the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) will encourage more homeowners to opt for renewable heating technology using heat pumps. There are also green sources of fuel, such as hydrogen and electricity, that will become increasingly popular for powering heating systems.
As a result, businesses in these sectors will need to know how to install new technologies if they want to guarantee a steady flow of work in the future.
Only got a few minutes to spare? No problem, head down to the FAQs section for a quick overview.
Challenges in the plumbing industry
To reach net-zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2050, there will need to be a massive change in the way we heat our homes and other buildings. According to the Climate Change Committee, the built environment accounts for around 17% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions, so even minor adjustments will have a big impact.
The government has committed to replacing the traditional gas boiler in place of more sustainable alternatives. To make sure your business stays ahead of the curve, you will have to invest time and money to get familiar with low-carbon heating systems and their different installation requirements.
This will rely on the plumbing industry having the correct training and information available, which is why this guide serves to point you in the right direction and brush up your knowledge.
Training 
First of all, gaining accreditation from Microgeneration Accreditation Scheme (MCS) is vital for assuring clients that your work meets industry standards. This will also come in very handy for attracting more business not just because of quality assurance, but also due to the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI)
The RHI is a government scheme that encourages homeowners to purchase and install more renewable heating systems. It pays owners of eligible renewable heating systems for the energy they generate and reimburses the owner for up to 80% of the upfront installation cost over seven years. For this reason, acquiring MCS accreditation will attract more opportunities as homeowners need to hire MCS installers to qualify for the RHI.
Industry-Led Training Programmes 
There are several industry courses that will be really valuable for enhancing your skills and knowledge in this new market. The  BEIS Skills Training Competition , for example, is a programme that tradespeople can apply to for free or subsidised training. It covers home energy retrofitting and low-carbon heat installation. Institutions such as CIBSE and CIPHE are also providing low-carbon training courses for tradespeople to upskill themselves for the future. These will cover essential skills for efficient heating that apply to all technology types, including:
Heat loss calculations
Hydraulic balancing
Pipe and emitter sizing
Low-flow-temperature heating
If you’re looking to expand your business and prepare your employees for the future, the MCS has a new low-carbon apprenticeship that could be just the ticket. This apprenticeship will be a level 3 qualification covering the basics of low-carbon heating technologies, including common installation processes and planning, technology specific theory and practical assessments. Whether you’re taking on an extra pair of hands or developing your current workforce, this apprenticeship will ensure they’re trained in renewable heating installations.

Heat pumps
Heat pumps provide low-carbon heating by transferring heat from a source outside of the home into the property. Their primary function is space heating through radiators or underfloor heating systems, but can also be used to heat water for use in a home or other building.
Heat pumps are low-temperature systems so they need a larger surface area and higher flow rate to achieve enough heat output. You’ll need to be able to advise homeowners on whether their radiators are of an appropriate size for a heat pump to be installed – if not, the system won’t be able to perform properly. For help on this, check out our blog  here . Making accurate heat loss calculations for each room will also help.
Due to their low heat output, heat pumps are unable to heat water instantaneously and need a hot water storage cylinder for support. This means you’ll need to factor in the space a pump and cylinder take up, as well as some room around them to ensure their work effectively. ASHPs, for example, need access to outdoor air, so the inlets cannot be restricted by other objects.
When retrofitting, the storage cylinder will need to be deemed suitable for a heat pump, as the cylinders found in traditional boiler systems tend to be inefficient and may lack the coil size required to transfer enough heat. In this case, you may need to install a low-temperature-ready unit.
Keep in mind, you’ll need to assess the required pipe size when designing a system. Many newer homes contain microbore pipework that may not be able to provide sufficient water flow for heat transfer. In these circumstances, additional equipment or replacement pipework may be needed.
Hydrogen boilers
Hydrogen fuel is an abundant, carbon-free alternative to natural gas, which is why heating manufacturers are starting to design hydrogen-ready boilers. A hydrogen boiler is very similar to a natural gas boiler, but it does burn differently so there will be some design changes inside the boiler itself.
On the whole, hydrogen boilers could be installed and connected to the network in much the same way. Only a few components would need to change, such as the flame detector and burner. The installation process will also be fairly similar, with no extra space or equipment required. It should be fairly straightforward to get yourself familiarised with this type of system.
District heating networks
This involves supplying heat from a central source to a number of homes via a network of underground pipes carrying hot water, avoiding the need for individual boilers or electric heaters in every building.
There are several ways you can provide the input to a heat network. Anything from power stations and fuel cells, to heat pumps and electric boilers would work.
Heat is brought into each building through a ‘heat exchanger’, which is about the same size as a small gas boiler. Some heat networks will include a heat interface unit (HIU) within each property. HIUs are the bridge between the heat network and the individual property.
District heating is already quite common, with over 17,000 networks already installed in the UK. They will continue to be a popular way to heat buildings, especially as the latest generation is matched to lower flow temperatures generated from renewable heat sources. You can read more about them  here .
FAQs
What’s new in the plumbing industry?
Sustainability is becoming more important to both the government and consumers, and the plumbing industry is beginning to follow suit. Research shows people are more conscious of their purchasing habits nowadays and seek out products that can help the planet as well as their finances, so your business must adapt quickly to capitalise on the demand.
What is a low-carbon heating system?
Simply put, a low-carbon heating system allows heat to be generated with a renewable source and produces less greenhouse gas emissions as a result.
When are gas boilers being banned? 
New gas boiler installations aren’t expected to be banned outright before 2035, so you can still fit them in a customer’s home if they request a replacement unit. However, this may change in the future so keep an eye on the news. That said, gas boilers are set to be phased out from all new build homes from 2025.
What new heating technologies do I need to be aware of? 
The government plans to install 600,000 heat pumps every year up to 2028 so expect to see more demand for this technology from your customers, especially with the Renewable Heat Incentive providing financial support.
While not quite ready to roll out, hydrogen fuel is fast becoming an alternative to traditional gas. There are already trials taking place and most manufacturers now have a model than can run solely on hydrogen or blended with natural gas.

How to start a hot tub installation company,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-start-a-hot-tub-installation-company/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a hot tub installation company

People are always looking for ways to add some luxury to their home, so it’s no wonder hot tubs are such a popular feature nowadays. In 2020 alone, demand rose by over 1000% as many sought to make the most of their outdoor space during lockdown.
But not just anyone can install a hot tub. It takes professional knowledge and skill to get them up and running, and customers need regular maintenance and support to keep them in top working condition. As such, now is a perfect time to set up your own hot tub installation business and make the most of rising demand.
Of course, going solo can be a daunting prospect, which is why this guide will take you through exactly how to start a hot tub installation business and reap the rewards.
Only got five minutes to spare? Head down to the FAQs section at the bottom of this page for some quick answers to the most common queries.
Do I need qualifications to start a hot tub installation business?
Having the right qualifications is really important for any startup. These credentials show potential customers that you have developed professional skills in the industry, which will encourage them to hire your services.

There are several areas to cover if you’re going to set your business up properly.
Registration
First of all, you’ll have to register your business with HMRC and state your structure. As a limited company, you’ll have the benefits of better financial security and less tax to deal with. Despite these advantages it’s also worth considering sole trading, especially if you’re sure you won’t need to bring in team members. This structure can be an easier route when starting your business as there’s less paperwork to worry about.
That said, hot tub installation usually requires extra labour for heavy lifting and general support. For more information on the pros and cons when choosing your business structure, read our guide  here .
Insurance
In the rare instance that a customer is left unhappy with your service or you make a mistake, you’re going to need protection from legal fees. In these cases, having hot tub business insurance will be really important for covering all bases. Here are the main types of insurance to consider: Public liability insurance  – Protects your business against customer claims if they believe you’ve damaged their property as a result of your work
Employers’ liability insurance – If you hire employees, you’re legally required to have them covered with this insurance policy Professional indemnity insurance  – Covers you in the event you make a mistake that causes the customer financial loss
Tools insurance – Covers the cost of replacing your tools if they’re lost or damaged due to flooding, theft or fire. Click  here  for more information on keeping your tools safe.
Business plan
Preparation is key when starting a business, so you’ll need to put together a solid plan that covers the ins and outs of your service. You want your business to suit your skills and expertise but also stand out from the competition, so keep these things in mind when outlining your service.
For example, if you have construction skills alongside your ability to wire hot tubs, you could offer to lay foundations as part of your hot tub installation service. Alternatively, you can use your experience with hot tubs to provide a comprehensive service that includes accessory installations and regular maintenance. By applying these ideas to your business plan, you’ll have the potential to establish a profitable niche and attract more clients.
Pricing
A fair pay rate will be important for securing business opportunities. If you set your prices too high, potential customers will look elsewhere. But if you go too low on your pay rates, you’ll be struggling to generate profit for your business.
It’s best to scout out the price ranges of your competitors so you can find a balance and set a competitive pay rate going forward. If you’re looking to offer hot tub maintenance as part of your service and you’re not sure what to charge, you can check out our article  here  for some ballpark figures.
Finances 
The only way you’ll know if your business is profitable is by keeping a close eye on the numbers, so you’ll need to make a habit of checking the ingoings and outgoings.
Being aware of your cashflow will allow you to have a good idea of how your business is performing and see where you might need to make some financial adjustments.
In the beginning, you may find yourself operating at a loss due to the upfront costs of equipment, insurance and registration. If this is a concern, you could consider taking out a business loan to cover the costs while you get up and running. Just remember to watch out for the interest rates.
Along with transactions, you should also keep on top of your taxes. There are several taxes that’ll apply to your business, so it’s important to understand what you should be filing on a regular basis. If you’re struggling to get your head around it all, or need some extra help documenting them, you could always hire an accountant. For more information on accountancy services, read our handy guide  here .
Marketing
When starting a business, it’s vital that you take steps to attract more customers and grow your client base. This means you’ll need to use marketing strategies that promote your start-up effectively.  Becoming a Checkatrade member  is a great way to do exactly that. While you might traditionally rely on word-of-mouth recommendations, Checkatrade allows you to build an online portfolio that displays your customer recommendations for all to see. This way, you can really enhance your reputation and make sure your business is being advertised to a wide audience of over three million monthly site users.
As online presence is so important for any business nowadays, you should consider setting up your own website that potential customers can access as a source of information and contact details. Creating profiles on social media can likewise prove very useful as you’ll be opening up your business to new audiences – plus you can segment your targets. You’ll also be able to drum up new business and develop client relationships by interacting with users and showcasing your best work.
It’s worth keeping in mind print marketing too. This is great for attracting local business, which will save you time and money on travel in the long run. You could distribute leaflets around surrounding neighbourhoods to raise your profile in the area.
Make sure you set up and trade in an area where there’s plenty of opportunities. It makes no sense targeting homeowners who have small gardens where a hot tub won’t fit. That said, there are a range of products designed for urban living, so think about how you can offer these if you’re based in densely populated area like London or Manchester.
FAQs
Do you need an electrician to install a hot tub? 
Under Part P of Building Regulations, it’s a legal requirement to have all electrical wiring work carried out by a fully qualified electrician. Seeing as hot tubs include electrical wiring, installation will need to be completed by someone with electrician qualifications.
What is the average cost to install a hot tub?
If the hot tub only needs basic electrical work to be installed, this will usually cost between £100 to £350. But, if you have to factor in delivery, new wiring and accessories this may add up to significantly more. In these scenarios, the price can vary from around £750 to £2000.

expect to pay anything from £139 to £362. Passive House cost per m2 When planning to upgrade your home to a Passive House you’ll need to set a budget for what you can afford. Remember, while the price you pay may be quite high, you’ll make huge savings on your energy bills.
For reference, the 
average Passive House cost per m2 will usually fall between £1,500 and £3,900. Passive House certification cost In order for your home to qualify as a Passive House, you’ll need to meet the standards set out and apply for certification. In addition, you’ll need to pay for your Passive House to be assessed, which can be quite costly. The 
average Passive House certification cost is £1,500
. Building close to the Passivhaus standards Many people are looking to reap the rewards that come with owning a Passivhaus but simply can’t afford the extensive renovations necessary. That’s why some homeowners choose to build close to the Passivhaus standards without going over their budgets. You’ll still enjoy a range of benefits for a more affordable price.
The 
average cost to
build close to the Passivhaus standard is £2,000 per m2
. Considering upgrading to a Passive House?

How to replace a light switch,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/replace-light-switch/,Living Room,"How to replace a light switch

In This Blog: How to replace a light switch How to replace a double light switch How to replace a light switch with a dimmer How to replace a 3 way light switch How to replace a pull cord light switch FAQs Learning how to replace a light switch might seem simple. However, these practical items come in various shapes, sizes, and materials with different functionalities. If you’re hoping to replace one yourself, you might be looking to upgrade from a plain design to a more stylish model. Alternatively, you might be hoping to swap an existing switch to a dimmer or double control panel that lets you manage your lighting more easily.
Although changing a light switch is relatively simple, working with electronics comes with various risks. That’s why it’s always worth  hiring a professional . If you’re looking to do it yourself, read on for our top tips and expert advice.
Check out our  cost to replace a light switch  guide for information on pricing up your project. How to replace a light switch Types of light switch
There are several types of light fittings or ‘plate switches’ that have one to three (or more) switches (aka gangs) on a panel. There are also two or multi-way switches that allow you to control more than one light. And when it comes to fittings, there are various plastic, metal, or stylized options on the market. The same goes for dimmer options, which are wired in a similar way to standard switches. For most ceiling-mounted pull-cord switches, building regulations stipulate that they’re installed in shower rooms, wetrooms, or bathrooms.
Tools you’ll need for the job
Screwdriver to unscrew the light switch plates
Grounding strap
Circuit tester
Electrical tape
Wire cutters/strippers
Wire nut How to replace a double light switch Follow these steps if you’ve asked yourself, ‘how do I remove a light switch and replace it?’
Step one: Turn off the power
Electricity is dangerous and requires turning off in case you accidentally hurt yourself. This goes for wiring small items like a double light switch, so make sure you locate the electrical panel that feeds your entire home and turn off the power. This should be easy if you have breakers that are labelled correctly. However, if you’re unsure, turn the main power off just to be on the safe side.
Step two: Double-check the current isn’t live
Take off the faceplate on the light switch you want to replace using your screwdriver. Then, put on your grounding strap and put the other end on the metal in the box. Keep it there while you use your circuit tester to make sure there’s no electricity by pressing the contacts to each wire, including the space between wires. Once you’ve established there’s no current, continue to step three. If there is still a charge, go back to step one.
Step three: Identify each wire
Most light switches have three wires: hot (red or black) neutral (white), and grounding (bare, green, yellow or green and yellow stripes). For double switches, there will be multiple wires that go to each light fixture and one to the breaker box. Put some electrical tape around each individual hot wire (this is so you can identify them later) then group the rest of the wires coming from the wall box by their colours. Use some electrical tape to secure them (neutrals together and grounding together, etc.)
Step four: Strip the wires
Once you’ve isolated your groups, take your wire cutters and strip the insulation from each end of every grouped wire. Twist the bare ends and ‘cap’ them together with an electrical wire nut.
Step five: Connect the double light switch
Once your wires are capped, loosen (but don’t pull out!) the screws on the double light switch. This will reveal the old wire connections on the double light switch that you want to mimic with the new connections. To do this, wrap the ends of the hot wires (the ungrouped ones you wrapped in electrical tape) around the screws. You’ll also need to attach:
the breaker box hot wire to the black terminal screw; and
the hot wires leading to the light fixtures to the other two terminal screws.
Once you’ve wrapped the hot wires around their relevant terminal screws, tighten them up and secure the new switches to the switch box. Now all you need to do is replace your faceplate, turn the power back on, and test out your handiwork!

Hire the electrician your neighbours recommend  How to replace a light switch with a dimmer If you’re looking to replace your standard switch with a dimmer switch, these five simple steps will help:
Locate the circuit or fuse panel and make sure the power is turned off.
Remove the switch plate by unscrewing it and make sure the circuit is dead by testing it with your voltage tester.
Pull out the switch with the wires still attached by unscrewing it from the electrical box, then remove the wires from the old switch.
Dimmer switches tend to be connected to the house wiring instead of screw terminals. This means short lengths of wire come out of the switch body instead, making them an easier swap.
Most new fixtures come with wire nuts, so use them to attach the black wires coming out of the dimmer switch to the coloured wires attached to the terminals on the old switch. How to replace a 3 way light switch Three-way switches are handy when it comes to controlling light from two locations. For example, at the top and bottom of a staircase. Strangely, three-way light switches only apply to two switches that control one light. The ‘three’ refers to the three terminal screws these switches have.
Follow these steps to learn how to replace a 3-way light switch:
Locate the circuit or fuse panel and make sure the power is turned off.
Remove the switch plate by unscrewing it, then make sure the circuit is dead by testing it with your voltage tester.
Pull out the switch with the wires still attached by unscrewing it from the electrical box, then remove the wires from the old switch.
It’s worth noting that three-way switches have a minimum of three wires – four if there’s a ground wire. There will be two wires that attach to screw terminals (generally located at the top of the switch) and an additional wire attached to a dark-coloured (that isn’t green) screw terminal usually located at the bottom of the switch. This is the one you want to mark with a piece of electrical tape. 
Note:
Make sure you mark it on the same side as the switch directly above it using different-coloured tape.
Once you’ve tagged your wires, attach them to the corresponding terminals of the new switch. Alternatively, consider transferring one wire at a time if that’s easier.
If the current switch has a ground wire that’s green, then either attach the wire to the green screw terminal on the new switch or onto the electrical box.
Once you’ve finished wiring your new switch, push it back into the electrical box and screw it in place.
The final step is to screw on the switch plate and turn on the power.
Note:
Your replacement switch might have electrical screw connectors located in slightly different areas to the switch you’re replacing. However, most switches include a pair of terminals on opposite sides of the switch top with a single terminal at the bottom.

Hire the electrician your neighbours recommend  How to replace a pull cord light switch If your pull cord in your bathroom is discoloured or broken, it’s time to fix it. Thankfully, they’re quick and easy to replace, and you can buy one from most DIY shops.
To replace the pull cord, follow these steps:
Turn off the electrics in your house
Stand on a step ladder you’ve firmly secured
Find the clip at the top of the string, which will be near to the switch on the ceiling where it enters.
Unclip the worn pull cord and discard.
Clip your new cord into the fitting.
Turn back on your electrics.
Test that the new pull cord works and that the fit is secure. FAQs Can I replace a light switch myself?
If you’re a confident DIY’er, there’s no reason you can’t change a light switch yourself following our steps above. However, if you’re in any way unsure, we recommend filling in our  request a quote form  to get quotes from electricians near you.
Do you need an electrician to change a switch?
If you’re wondering whether you should  hire an electrician  or do the job yourself, we recommend assessing the job at hand and working out whether it requires a complex or simple solution. For a quick, safe, and secure fit, it’s worth spending a little extra to ensure a professional job.
When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews. Even better, those reviews are from your neighbours and checked by us to make sure they’re legitimate.

Laminate or wood flooring: What should you go for?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/laminate-or-wood-flooring/,"Kitchen, Living Room","Laminate or wood flooring: What should you go for?

In This Blog: Laminate vs wood – what’s best for your home? Engineered wood vs laminate flooring pros and cons Laminate vs hardwood Hiring a professional Which tradesperson should I use? Creating your dream home is never easy as there are so many different choices to make. But when it comes to flooring, if you’re sure that carpet isn’t for you, you’re probably weighing up if you’d like laminate or wood flooring.
Both can totally transform your living space but there are differences between the two. Laminate flooring is crafted by layering fibreboard, a photographic layer and a topcoat, while wood flooring is made from solid timber boards. There are differences in the installation process too, with laminate flooring easily clicking together whilst wood flooring has to be nailed in place.
There are differences in the way they look too. Wooden floors (unsurprisingly) look more natural and can be stained to the tone you like, whilst laminate flooring you can pick exactly what you would like before having it fitted. Read on for more tips and comparisons to help you choose your new flooring. Laminate vs wood – what’s best for your home? In order to decide which material is better for your home, we need to look at the pros and cons of both laminate and wood flooring. Below we’ve summarised the advantages and disadvantages of each type of flooring:
Laminate flooring
Advantages
: More affordable, more durable, low maintenance
Disadvantages: 
Can be damaged by too much moisture, reduced lifespan, more difficult to repair or replace
Wood flooring
Advantages
: Can easily be repaired, visually stunning, increases the value of your home, long lasting
Disadvantages
: Easier to damage and more expensive
If you have pets or children, laminate flooring is more durable so may be a better choice. In addition, if you’re on a budget, laminate is much more affordable. On the other hand, wood flooring looks incredible and can be repaired if it does become damaged. Engineered wood vs laminate flooring pros and cons If you love the appearance of wood flooring but hate the high price tag, engineered wood flooring may be a great alternative. Unlike laminate, engineered wood is made up of a thin layer of hardwood on top of a layer of plywood.
Looking at the below pros and cons of engineered wood vs laminate flooring is a great way of comparing the two materials:
Engineered wood
Pros: 
More authentic, has a lifespan of over 30 years
Cons: 
More easily damaged, harder to install
Laminate flooring
Pros: 
More affordable, easier to install,
Cons:
 Shorter lifespan of 10 – 20 years, difficult to replace a single board
Hopefully, this should help you to choose laminate or engineered wood flooring, but the decision really comes down to your circumstances both financial and lifestyle. Laminate vs hardwood For a truly natural feel to your home, it may be worth considering hardwood flooring. Where engineered wood has a thin layer of hardwood, hardwood flooring is made of boards of solid timber. This helps to add value to your property as well as add style to your living space.
So, let’s compare laminate vs hardwood:
Laminate flooring
Advantages:
 Inexpensive, easily clicks together, easy to maintain, water and stain resistant
Disadvantages:
 Less authentic, shorter lifespan
Hardwood flooring
Advantages:
 Natural and authentic appearance, longer lifespan, considered more prestigious
Disadvantages
: Harder to install, can be easily damaged by moisture Hiring a professional For the best results, we always recommend hiring a flooring professional for both laminate and wooden flooring. While you may be able to attempt a DIY job (more so with laminate flooring), remember that any mistakes can be expensive and very time consuming to fix.

In This Blog: Granite countertops cost Concrete countertop cost Granite vs concrete countertops cost Granite vs concrete countertops – pros and cons FAQs about the cost of granite and concrete countertops Choosing your kitchen countertop is a big decision, it will cover a large area of your kitchen and be at the centre of your room’s look and feel for years to come. Granite is a timeless, trusted choice, but more recently concrete has gained in popularity as people seek a more minimalist, industrial look.
In this guide we’ll look at 
granite vs concrete countertops cost
, including the installation cost too.
Project requirements
Cost + VAT (Range low - high)
Average cost
Granite countertop (3m2 installed)
£950 - £1,400
£1,175
Concrete countertop (3m2 installed)
£950 - £1,700

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Granite countertops cost One of the big attractions of granite countertops, aside from their resilience, is the fact that they come in many colours and variations. From natural white with brown or grey seams, to midnight black with gold leaf, you really can achieve a unique look in your kitchen using a granite countertop.
This variety is great at the design stage, but when it comes to costing it, it’s difficult to determine an exact price for your individual kitchen project. Typically, a granite countertop fully installed by a kitchen fitter in the UK will cost on average between 
£950 – £1,400 for a 3m2 section
. This also includes the removal of your old worktop. If you’re particularly DIY savvy, you might look to  cut and install a granite worktop  yourself.
Remember that the price of your granite worktop could be more if you opt for gold leaf. Or cost less, if you go for a standard granite design. Concrete countertop cost Look through any kitchen design magazine, Instagram account or Pinterest board and you’ll see plenty of polished concrete. It has increased in popularity of late due to a rising demand for minimalist, luxury kitchen designs that echo industrial environments.
Although it may seem like concrete countertops come only in grey, they can be tinted in a number of colours and finished to a variety of specifications, making general costing difficult.
For a kitchen project in the UK, you can expect to pay on average between 
£950 – £1,700 for a 3m2 section
 of concrete countertop fully installed by a kitchen fitter. Again, this includes the removal of your old worktop.

Find worktop experts your neighbours rated  Granite vs concrete countertops cost As you can see, the average granite vs concrete countertops cost including installation is quite similar, with concrete coming out slightly more expensive. However, with the price difference so small, it really does come down to how much you need and what style will best suit your vision for your kitchen. Granite vs concrete countertops – pros and cons When weighing up the cost of either granite or concrete countertops for your new kitchen, it can be useful to understand the pros and cons of each material.
Granite
Pros:
Granite is a natural stone, so if that’s important to you, then it’s the clear choice when compared with manmade concrete.
Granite is actually easy to repair, with DIY fixes possible on small chips.
It is also more resistant to heat than concrete, which is an important consideration in a kitchen.
A granite countertop requires less maintenance than a concrete countertop.
Cons:
Sometimes granite samples can be different to the actual worktops you receive.
Granite requires resealing every year, which can be done by a professional.
When to comes to the long-term look, granite is slightly porous, which can result in staining if particularly vivid foods and liquids aren’t cleaned up quickly.
Also, granite countertops typically have a larger carbon footprint than concrete countertops due to the work required to extract the stone, process it, and deliver it. This is particularly significant if an alternative concrete worktop is made from recycled materials.
Concrete
Pros:
Despite appearing to only be one shade of grey, there are in fact fifty shades or more you can choose from.
You can have patterns created in your concrete during the casting stage.
Concrete is incredibly hard and is almost impossible to scratch.
Unlike granite, which is limited by its natural 
occurrence
, concrete is available in any 
shape
 or size, 
giving
 you 
unlimited
 kitchen design possibilities.
If you love being green, your concrete countertops can be made from recycled concrete, which reduces your carbon footprint and can add character.
Cons:
Concrete countertops need to be made, unlike granite where Mother Nature does the making, which can mean a time-consuming casting and curing process.
While they are highly scratch-resistant
, concrete countertops do need more maintenance to keep them looking polished and pristine.
Concrete is tough, but it can crack over time as the bonds created during casting weaken.
Making new concrete requires a lot of energy to mix, bond and heat the ingredients, which has a carbon cost. FAQs about the cost of granite and concrete countertops Are concrete countertops cheaper than granite?
No. As you can see in the costs detailed above, on average you’ll pay more for concrete countertops vs granite countertops.
Of course, it could be that your specific concrete countertop is relatively low cost, the best way to know is to get quotes from kitchen countertop specialists.
Are concrete countertops more expensive than granite?
Yes. On average you’ll pay more for concrete countertops vs granite countertops, typically up to 
£300
more 
at the high-quality end.
As always, the best way to get an idea of the cost of your new kitchen countertops is to get quotes from local professionals. It’s easy to do this, simply enter your postcode in the free search tool below to get started.

FAQs A measured building survey cost can be impacted by a number of factors that we’ll cover off shortly. But first, let’s briefly outline exactly what a measured building survey is, and why you might need one. What is a measured building survey? A measured building survey is a highly detailed, digital version of a building or structure.
It’s a means of measuring and defining the geometrical characteristics and parametres of a building, providing an accurate representation that outlines all the structural elements and architectural features.
Measured surveys include:
Floor plans
Ceiling plans
Roof plans
Cross-sections
External elevations
Site plans
Once the building has been surveyed, drawings and/or a 3D model can be created.
The level of detail and accuracy provided by a measured building survey is priceless for a range of different reasons.
An  architect ,  structural engineer , developer, or designer can use the survey to plan and design refurbishments, redevelopments, or extensions.
A property developer can use them when planning the renovation or conversion of their domestic and commercial buildings.
A landlord can use the survey to assist with space planning or lease plans when determining the lettable areas of a property.
On the whole, a measured building survey will help to make sure new layouts, room sizes, fire protection systems, and materials can be planned confidently while avoiding costly mistakes.

Find measured building surveyors near you  How much does a measured building survey cost? A measured building survey cost is normally priced up on an individual basis as no two surveys are rarely the same.

Are chimneys a landlord’s responsibility?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/chimney-landlords-responsibility/,Living Room,"Are chimneys a landlord’s responsibility?

In This Blog: Chimney landlord responsibility Landlord responsibility for ventilation Landlord responsibility for chimney sweeping A cosy fire is one of life’s simplest but greatest pleasures that have been a part of homes for the most part of history. They do require regular maintenance for safety purposes. But what about in rented properties? In this guide, we take a look at what a landlord’s responsibility is when it comes to chimneys and ventilation. Chimney landlord responsibility As a landlord, you are responsible for fire safety in your rental property. Under  Section 11 of The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 , a landlord is legally responsible for ‘
ensuring the safety, working and servicing of all heating and hot water installations
‘. From this explanation, it is not immediately clear, but this does include open fires, Rayburn stoves, gas, coal, and wood-burning stoves.
If your rental property has an open fire, a wood-burning stove or the appliances mentioned then your landlord responsibilities are:
To follow fire safety regulations
To provide a  smoke alarm  on each storey and a carbon monoxide alarm in any room with a solid fuel-burning appliance (a coal fire or wood-burning stove)
To check your tenants have clear access to escape routes at all times
To ensure the furniture and furnishings you provide are fire safe
To provide fire alarms and extinguishers if the property is a large house in multiple occupations (HMO)
Fuel-burning and fires can pose a number of risks and health concerns for tenants, so it is vitally important to pay particular attention to these landlord responsibilities for chimneys.

Find recommended chimney sweeps near you  Landlord responsibility for ventilation Hand in hand with the responsibility for chimneys is the responsibility for ventilation.
The main concern in regards to ventilation is the health of the tenants. If your property has a fire, gas appliances or a fuel-burning stove, then as a landlord you have the responsibility to make sure that these items are serviced annually. You must also ensure that any flues are also maintained to provide the  proper ventilation .
A landlord’s responsibility for ventilation extends beyond fires and chimneys. One of the other potential areas for concern is mould and damp.
Landlords cannot put their tenants’ health at risk and so to help alleviate mould and damp you must try to put in as many condensation-management features as possible. If these can be automated then all the better. Examples of this would be installing a  mechanical ventilation and heat recovery system  (MVHR) or the use of  dehumidifiers .
A landlord also has the responsibility of educating the tenants on what they can do to avoid problems such as condensation that leads to damp. You should advise them to regularly open windows to let damp or humid air out of bathrooms and kitchens, and not to leave wet washing hanging up for too long. To help protect tenants and your property, you could consider adding a contractual requirement for your tenants to regularly ventilate the property. If you are considering adding any clauses into your tenancy agreement it is always recommended to seek legal advice before doing so. Landlord responsibility for chimney sweeping If your rental property has an open fire or wood-burning stove with a chimney, there are specific landlord responsibilities for  chimney sweeping . Before the start of a tenancy, as a landlord, you must make sure that chimneys and flues are swept and not blocked by any obstructions. The easiest way to keep on top of this is to  find a recommended local chimney sweep  and book in for periodic servicing and appointments to make sure any chimneys in your rental property are safe.
As part of your tenancy agreement, you can pass the responsibility for getting the chimney swept and in a safe and usable condition on to your tenants. However, it is highly recommended that as the landlord you take the responsibility for  chimney sweeping and maintenance .
As well as being important for general health and safety, chimney sweeping is also important for your insurance. Some underwriters make it very clear in their policies that in order to be adequately insured, chimneys and flues need to be regularly maintained. As the landlord, if you fail to ensure this happens, in the event of a chimney fire you may find that your policy may be invalid.
Chimneys should be swept at least once a year as a minimum and should always be swept before the colder months. Chimney sweeps provide a certificate to show that the necessary work has been completed so you should always keep an up-to-date record of when your chimney was swept.
Being a landlord comes with a lot of responsibilities. If you are unsure how best to look after your chimney, Aga or wood-burning stove then always seek the  advice of a professional .

Landlord responsibilities for common areas,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/landlord-responsibility-common-areas/,Garden,"Landlord responsibilities for common areas

In This Blog: Landlord responsibilities for common areas Landlord responsibility for a communal entrance door Landlord regulations for the stairs and hallway Landlord garden responsibilities Landlord fence responsibilities What to do if a landlord is not taking responsibility for communal areas FAQs Many tenanted properties have communal areas, such as the entrance door, hallway, stairs, and garden. But who’s responsible for the maintenance and repair of these shared spaces?
In this post, with support from the  British Landlord Association , we’ll outline the landlord’s responsibility for common areas, and what aspects fall to the tenant. Landlord responsibilities for common areas The tenancy agreement will usually state who’s responsible for the maintenance and repair of communal areas. As a rule of thumb, a landlord is generally responsible, especially if the tenancy is an Assured shorthold for making necessary repairs to a rental property, and a tenant is responsible for maintaining it.
A tenant should only carry out repairs if this is outlined in the tenancy agreement.
A tenant cannot be forced to do repairs that are the landlord’s responsibility.
The cost of repairs that are a landlord’s responsibility cannot be passed on to the tenant.
The Defective Premises Act 1972
A landlord must keep a tenanted property safe and free from hazards.
The Defective Premises Act 1972 sets out the duties of care a landlord owes a tenant. Landlords have a duty of care to prevent personal injury (to the tenants, their families, and visitors) or damage to property caused by defects in the property.
The duty is owed where the landlord is under an obligation to repair or maintain the rented property (or has a right to enter the property to carry out maintenance or repairs). The duty of care under this act is owed if the landlord knows, or should have known, about the repair.
This often relates to common areas, as the landlord controls this part of the building, i.e. they should be able to identify repairs themselves, without the tenant informing them. Landlord responsibility for a communal entrance door So what’s a landlord’s legal responsibility for the communal entrance door of a tenanted property?
Well, when it comes to the communal entrance door, a landlord is responsible for:
The repair of defective external doors, saddles, and door frames.
Hinges, locks, handles, trapper bars, and letterboxes on external doors.
The door entry system to a communal entrance.
The tenant should contact the landlord or letting agent as soon as a problem is identified to ensure the property is safe and secure. Landlord regulations for the stairs and hallway A landlord’s responsibility for the stairs and hallway includes: 
Walls, staircases, and all structural timbers.
Architraves, skirting boards, timber sills, and other internal decorative woodwork.
Floor tiling.
Any airbricks and ventilators.
Any electrical wiring in the hallway, socket outlets, and switches.
Ceiling roses, lamp holders, and flexes.
A landlord must also follow fire safety regulations. This includes smoke alarms, access to escape routes, and fire alarms and extinguishers if the property is a large  house in multiple occupation (HMO) .
The law implies a condition into every tenancy agreement that the tenant must use their home in a ‘tenant-like’ way. This includes the tenant (and their visitors) not causing any damage to the property. If a tenant does cause damage to the communal areas, the landlord should be notified immediately so the necessary repairs and associated costs can be discussed.

Find a property maintenance specialist in your area  Landlord garden responsibilities When it comes to the garden, a landlord is responsible for the tasks that would be unreasonable for the tenant to do themselves. Typically, this includes  hedge trimming , tree maintenance, and  pruning shrubs .
As long as they were installed by the landlord, the landlord is responsible for repairs to:
Garden paths Walls Gates The tenant is responsible for general maintenance, i.e. jobs that need to be done regularly. This normally includes tasks such as cleaning,  lawn mowing , weeding, and sweeping.
Our post on  landlord garden maintenance  covers this area in more detail. It also explains what to do in the event of a dispute over landlord or tenant garden responsibility. Landlord fence responsibilities The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and the Housing Act 2004 both define the responsibility for the repair and maintenance of the structure and interior of a property as being down to the landlord. This includes the exterior of the property, not forgetting the fences.
A landlord is responsible for the fences in a tenanted property 
that they have installed
. They are also responsible for the  cost of repair or replacement of fences  that have been damaged by natural forces, e.g. a storm or flood.
A tenant is responsible for the cost of repair to fencing if:
The tenant has installed the fencing.
The tenant has caused damage to the fencing that the landlord has installed.
The fencing has been damaged due to the tenant’s negligence or anything that breaches the terms of the tenancy agreement.
If a landlord needs to carry out repair work to a communal area, such as the garden, they do not have to inform the tenant. What to do if a landlord is not taking responsibility for communal areas If a landlord fails to make the necessary repairs to their tenanted property, the tenant should contact the environmental health department at the  local council . In Scotland, contact the  Private Rented Housing Panel (PRHP) .
If the rented property is unsafe or unfit for human habitation, a tenant should ask for the housing department at the local council. They will do a  Housing Health and Safety Rating System assessment  and will take action if they deem your home to have serious health and safety hazards. There are different procedures for tenants in  Scotland  and  Northern Ireland .

Find a property maintenance specialist in your area  FAQs What regulations are there for stairs?
A landlord should make sure that the treads, risers, nosings, balustrades, and handrails are complete and in good condition. Ideally, the stairs should be at least 900mm wide to allow an adult and child to use the stairs side-by-side in the event of an emergency. There should be good lighting (and switches for lighting) at the top and bottom of the stairs. In an HMO property, landlords are responsible for the stair covering and making sure the stairs are not obstructed.
What is a landlord’s legal responsibility for a communal entrance door?
A landlord’s legal responsibility for a communal entrance door includes the door itself and any hardware – hinges, locks, handles, trapper bars, and letterboxes. The landlord’s responsibility also extends to the door entry system to a communal entrance.
Can a tenant sue a landlord for falling down the stairs?
This is not a clear-cut ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. Should a tenant fall down the stairs of their tenanted property, many aspects would be considered, including whether there were any defects to the stairs, and whether the landlord had been informed of those defects.

Landlord rights,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/landlord-rights/,Tag Not Found,"Landlord rights

In This Blog: Landlord eviction rights A landlords right to terminate a lease Landlord access rights Landlord rights and coronavirus A Landlords right to increase rent A landlords right to sell property with tenants FAQs Do you know your rights as a landlord? Whether you’re thinking of becoming a landlord for the first time, or if you simply need a reminder, we’re taking a look at some of the legal rights of a landlord in England and Wales. This article has been reviewed and contributions made by experts at   The British Landlords Association. Landlord eviction rights As a landlord, hopefully, you will never have to end a tenancy through eviction, but should you need to, these are your rights as a landlord. You have two main options if you need to evict your tenants You can use either: Section 21  – This is where you can take back possession of your property after a fixed-term tenancy agreement ends or a break clause is due. In this case, there is usually no wrongdoing on the tenants’ part.
Section 8 – This is for when you need to evict a tenant for serious issues such as non-payment of rent, causing a nuisance, or damage to your property. This is typically what you think of when you think of eviction.
Landlords can use Section 21 for a variety of reasons, including their wish to move into the property themselves or to sell their property without the extra complication of having a tenant living there. Under your rights as a landlord, you can also use Section 21 if you are concerned about your tenants’ ability to pay the rent or if they are in arrears with their payments to you.
As a landlord, you do need to be aware that some tenancies can only be ended for a legal reason, commonly known as ‘grounds’. Landlords must prove a legal ground in court to get an eviction order. Some of the common grounds for eviction are rent arrears or nuisance or antisocial behaviour. Some grounds are classed as mandatory, which means the court must order tenants to leave if the landlord can prove the ground. Other grounds are discretionary which means the court may decide to let tenants stay even if the landlord can prove the ground.
When drawing up a tenancy agreement it is always important to get the advice of a legal professional and pay careful attention to the law, especially around the topic of what can end a tenancy agreement. A landlords right to terminate a lease If you find yourself in the position of needing to terminate your tenant’s lease, you must give them notice in a particular way, including certain information and warnings. The information and notice you need to give will depend on the type of tenancy agreement and its terms.
Assured shorthold tenancy
As a landlord, you can take back possession of your property if you have a periodic tenancy or a fixed-term tenancy that has ended. You must give written notice to your tenants and the amount of notice you need to give them will depend on when you have served, or intend to serve the notice to quit. The notice periods are as follows:
Two months if they gave you notice before 26 March 2020
Three months if they gave you notice between 26 March 2020 and 28 August 2020
Six months if they gave you notice between 29 August 2020 and 31 May 2021
Four months if they gave you notice between 1 June 2021 and 30 September 2021
Two months if they gave you notice on or after 1 October 2021 in England and six months in Wales
In England, you must give at least two months notice.
Fixed-term tenancy
If you have a fixed-term tenancy agreement, your landlord right to terminate their lease means that you can only ask your tenants to leave on certain grounds including if the tenant is behind with rent payments, they are using the property for illegal practises, or they have damaged the property.
If you’re using a Section 8 notice to terminate the lease, depending on the reason for eviction, your tenants may need to leave sooner than the two months notice period. With a fixed-term tenancy, if your tenants are behind in rent payments of up to four months (also known as ‘non-serious’ arrears) you must give them two months to leave the property.
Excluded tenancies or licenses
If your tenant is living as a lodger then if you intend to terminate the lease, you need to give them a notice period which is as long as their rental payment period, which is usually monthly. In the case of a tenant who is a lodger, you do not need to give them notice in writing.
Non excluded licence or tenancy
With this type of agreement, you can terminate the lease at any time with a notice to quit and give four weeks notice.
Break clauses
If you wish to end a fixed-term tenancy agreement but have a break clause, as a landlord you cannot issue a notice to quit during the fixed term unless under specific grounds. The next time you would be able to end the lease would be after the fixed term.
As you can see there are many different legal requirements when it comes to terminating a lease agreement, which is why it is so important to seek the advice of a legal professional. As a landlord, it is always important to be clear in the terms of your tenancy agreements.

Find a recommended removals company  Landlord access rights There may be occasions as a landlord when you will need to gain access to your rental property when your tenants are living there. Although as the landlord you own the property, you must get the tenant’s consent before visiting. If a landlord or anyone acting on the landlord’s behalf enters the property without prior tenant’s consent, this is trespassing and will be in breach of the tenancy agreement.
Once a tenant has moved in, as a landlord you should give at least 24 hours written notice before visiting the rental property and a text message or email is sufficient. The notice should include the time and date of the visit and who will be visiting the property, and why. Your tenants have the right to ‘quiet enjoyment’ which is a broad and general term, that essentially means that your tenants are obliged to be given their privacy. Any clause in a tenancy agreement that permits a landlord to visit the property whenever they like, without notice or permission, would be seen by law as an unfair term and considered void if there was any dispute.
A landlord does have very specific rights which give them legitimate access to the property. Section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 states that a landlord has an obligation to maintain and repair:
The structure and exterior of the property (including drains,  gutters  and external pipes),
The installations in the property for the supply of water, gas and electricity and for sanitation, and
The installations in the property for space heating and heating water.
A landlord, or someone instructed by the landlord, like a plumber or gas engineer, will need access to the property to carry out these repairs.
In addition to access for repairs, a landlord also has a right to view the condition of a property. A landlord or someone acting as their agent, from a letting agency for example can gain access to the property at a “reasonable time of the day” but only after giving the tenant a minimum of 24 hours notice in writing. During the tenancy, as a landlord, you may wish to visit the property to conduct a mid-term inspection and again, 24 hours notice is required to be given to your tenants.
There are times when it is acceptable for a landlord to access the property without prior notice and these are emergency scenarios such as:
A fire in the property
Structural damage that requires urgent attention
Water flowing from the building
A strong smell of gas
Suspicion of a violent or criminal incident
A serious concern for welfare
In any of these cases, as a landlord, you must behave ‘reasonably’ and obtain photographic evidence of any issues that are evident and get signed inspections from contractors that you have employed to remedy the situation. Landlord rights and coronavirus Due to the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020,  The Coronavirus Act 2020  was brought in. This gave tenants extra protection and in the case of ending tenancy agreements, increased the notice period to four months, except in cases such as serious rent arrears or anti-social behaviour. From 1st October 2021, the notice period has been reduced to the pre-pandemic position.
Under The Coronavirus Act 2020, rent is still legally due but if tenants are having difficulty paying their rent due to their employment situation then it advises that they should speak to their landlord at the earliest opportunity. To help assist with this unprecedented situation, the government has worked with the National Residential Landlords Association to produce  a guide to managing arrears and avoiding possession claims  in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.
Ending a tenancy early due to the pandemic
The coronavirus pandemic has affected everybody differently, and landlords have also felt the impact. If a tenant wishes to end the tenancy early due to the pandemic, as a landlord you can charge a fee but this fee must not be greater than the loss that you as the landlord would incur from loss of the rental income or associated costs including the use of a letting agent. The government’s guidance on the  Tenant Fees Act  contains more information.
Landlord repairs and maintenance during the pandemic
Any repairs or maintenance work should be carried out as per the tenancy agreement but in accordance with the  working safely guidance . For more information and advice see the  Covid 19 renting guidance for landlords and tenants .

Find a recommended removals company  A Landlords right to increase rent During your time as a landlord, you may need to or wish to increase the rent that your tenants pay you. The tenancy agreement you have with your tenants should include how and when the rent will be reviewed. For a periodic tenancy (rolling on a week-by-week or month-by-month basis) as a landlord, you cannot usually increase the rent more than once a year. For a fixed-term tenancy (running for a set period) you can only increase the rent if your tenants agree. If they don’t, the rent can only be increased when the fixed term comes to an end.
When you do increase the rent, any rise in payment must be fair and realistic and should be in line with average local rents in the area and for the type of property.  As part of a landlords right to increase the rent you can:
Renew your tenancy agreement at the end of the fixed term, but with an increased rent
Agree to a rent increase with tenants and produce a written record of the agreement that you both sign
Use a ‘Landlord’s notice proposing a new rent’ form Section 13 notice, which increases the rent after the fixed term has ended
As a landlord, to increase the rent you must give a minimum of one month’s notice if the rent is paid weekly or monthly. If there is a yearly tenancy, then you must give six months notice to increase the rent.
For more info see the  Gov.UK guidance on rent increases . A landlords right to sell property with tenants There may come a time that you wish to sell your rental property, so what are your landlord rights to sell a property when you have tenants? The good news is you can sell your property when you still have tenants, and there are two options. You can either sell the property with the tenancy or terminate the tenancy and complete the sale after the property is vacant.
Selling with the tenancy
 – With this option, you will sell your property with your tenant(s) remaining as residents, subject to the existing tenancy. This means your tenant(s) will remain in the property after the sale is completed, and they will then start paying rent to the new owner and the property will be kept as a buy to let.
Completing the sale after possession (i.e. eviction)
 – In this case, you would need to end the tenancy before the sale is completed, so the property is vacant upon completion. This can be more complicated as you may lose income whilst you wait for your tenants to vacate. It can also be harder to organise viewings with your tenants as you will need to give them notice. You may also experience issues with the condition of the property if you are trying to sell whilst your tenants are still in residence.
Being a landlord means you have a number of responsibilities and there are a lot of rules and regulations to keep track of. If you are unsure about anything with regards to your tenancy agreements, always seek the advice of a professional before taking action. FAQs Does a landlord have the right to change the locks?
It is illegal for a landlord to change the locks without permission unless it is an emergency or if the tenants are lodgers and live in the same property as the landlord.

How to become an HMO landlord,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/how-to-become-hmo-landlord/,Tag Not Found,"How to become an HMO landlord

In This Blog: What is an HMO? HMO requirements HMO license cost HMO council tax HMO mortgage HMO expenses HMO management regulations HMO fire regulations HMO minimum room size HMO planning permission HMO insurance HMO inspection FAQs If you’ve ever wondered how to become an HMO landlord and what the HMO landlord responsibilities are, then this guide is for you. We’ve created a complete overview with support from the  British Landlord Association . What is an HMO? An HMO is also known as 
Houses of Multiple Occupation
. A  student house  or a house share is the perfect example. The definition of an HMO is a property where three or more unrelated people live there as at least two separate households – for example, three single people with their own rooms, or two couples each sharing their own room.
To be classed as an HMO, the property has to meet certain HMO requirements which we’ll cover in more detail in the guide below. One of the defining features of an HMO is that all occupants share basic amenities, such as a kitchen or bathroom.
In a situation where five or more tenants from the same household live together in a rented property, this is classed as a large HMO. Hostels and B&Bs that are not just for holidays and leisure use can also be licensed as an HMO. HMO requirements If you’re considering becoming an HMO landlord, you should contact your local authority to find out what license is required. There are some basic and some quite specific HMO requirements which are:
The house must be suitable for the number of tenants, meaning it should be of the appropriate size and have enough of the right facilities.
As the manager of the house (you or an agent) must not have a criminal record and must not be in breach of landlord laws or the code of practice.
To display information and guidance in the common areas.
In accordance with the Housing Act 2004, to be defined as an HMO, the building must fall within one of the following categories:
A building or flat in which more than one household shares a basic amenity, such as bathrooms, toilets, or cooking facilities. This is known as the ‘standard test’ or the ‘self-contained flat test’.
A building that has been converted and does not just comprise of self-contained flats: this is known as the ‘converted building test’.
A building that is declared as an HMO by the local authority.
A converted block of flats where the standard of the conversion does not meet the relevant building standards and fewer than two-thirds of the flats are owner-occupied: this is known as a section 257 HMO.
Once obtained, an HMO license is valid for a maximum of five years and if you have multiple HMO properties, you will need a separate license for each.

Find landlord inventory specialists near you  HMO license cost HMO landlords that operate without a license risk an unlimited fine. Aside from the financial implications, obtaining an HMO license is also important for safety reasons.
There are two main categories of licensing. The first category is for a small HMO, where at least three people who are not from the same household live together and share facilities. In this scenario, you may not need an HMO license but you should check with your local council as the regulations vary dependant on your location. The cost of this license will also vary.
Your local council can implement a ‘selective’ licensing scheme for HMO properties that are not subject to mandatory licensing. This can include properties in certain geographical areas, such as student houses close to universities, and also blocks converted into self-contained flats.
For HMOs where five or more people share facilities and form more than one household to form a ‘large HMO’ a license is mandatory. Local councils decide their own fee for how much to charge for mandatory HMO licenses, so the cost will vary according to your location. HMO license fees should not be excessive as they should only cover the cost of running the licensing scheme.
When you want to submit an HMO license application, you will need Gas Safety and Electrical safety certificates for the property, as well as the floor plan of the property. You can apply for a license on the  government website . If you submit an application for an HMO license and your HMO license application is turned down, your application fee will be refunded to you. HMO council tax If you’re considering becoming an HMO landlord then you may be wondering who is responsible for paying the council tax? This ultimately depends on how your HMO set up fits within the  Regulation 2 Council Tax (Liability for Owners) Regulations 1992 .
If you let your rooms as bedsits or operate using license agreements (this is less common) then you as the landlord are responsible for paying the council tax. If you have a contract or tenancy agreement where a group of tenants shares the property together then the tenant is responsible.
The tenant is also responsible if your HMO rooms are let on a room-by-room basis where each room has its own council tax band. In this situation, each room is classed as its own separate dwelling, and therefore each tenant is responsible for paying their own council tax.
To make sure all parties understand, it is worthwhile having a clause in your tenancy agreement to say who is responsible for the council tax. HMO mortgage If you plan to run an HMO and you require a mortgage, specialist buy-to-let mortgages have some key differences:
HMO mortgages are usually linked to rates like LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) rather than the Bank of England base rate.
To be successfully offered a buy-to-let mortgage, landlords have to prove their experience of borrowing before taking one out
Maximum loan to value (LTV) is typically between 60-75%
HMO mortgages can be more expensive than typical mortgages due to the LIBOR rate and additional fees. This is something to bear in mind if you plan to become an HMO landlord as it can eat into your profits.
For more information, take a look at our  buy-to-let guide for landlords . HMO expenses As an HMO landlord, you will of course have to pay the usual landlord expenses such as property upkeep and maintenance, utility bills and letting agent fees if you use a letting agent.
Additional HMO expenses are the cost of the license and any associated legal fees that may be required to successfully become an HMO landlord.

Find landlord inventory specialists near you  HMO management regulations HMO landlords are also required to meet certain HMO management regulations. These include:
Ensuring appropriate  fire safety measures  are in place, including working  smoke alarms .
Ensuring annual  gas safety checks  are carried out. Checking the electrics  every five years.
Supplying enough cooking and bathroom facilities for the number of tenants living there.
Providing communal areas and shared facilities that are  clean and in good repair .
Making sure the structure and exterior of the house are safe and in a good state of repair, including the walls, window frames, and gutters.
Supplying enough rubbish bins to safely dispose of household waste.
Keeping the gas and water pipes in good working order and serviced regularly.
Maintain and service any fixed heaters (such as radiators) and water heaters.
Ensure the property is not overcrowded. HMO fire regulations In addition to the regulations above, HMO landlords also have to comply with the following fire regulations.
As an HMO landlord you must:
Install and maintain  smoke detectors and alarms Send the council an updated  gas safety certificate  each year
Provide safety certificates for all electrical appliances each year or upon request.
Most newer homes now have smoke alarms that have a mains powered back up which offers a higher level of safety and protection. If your smoke alarms are battery-powered you must make sure to check and test them regularly.
When getting your gas appliances and electrical appliances serviced, you must ensure that you use tradespeople who possess the correct qualifications and accreditations –  such as a gas safe registered heating engineer to service your boiler. HMO minimum room size Part of the HMO management regulations relate to providing enough space for people to live comfortably and safely.
If you plan to become an HMO landlord then you need to ensure that your tenants’ rooms comply with the minimum room sizes below. Your local council may have individual standards so if you are applying for an HMO license you should check before making your application.
6.51 square metres for a person aged 10 or over
10.22 square metres for two people aged 10 or over
4.64 square metres for a child under 10 years old HMO planning permission If you are looking to turn an existing property into an HMO, the existing ‘use class’ will influence whether or not you need planning permission. The main use classes for residential properties are C3 for a primary or secondary dwelling, C4 for an HMO, and Sui Generis for a large HMO.
HMO regulations are always changing so it is important to seek professional advice before beginning any work. HMO insurance As an HMO landlord, you will also need a specialist HMO insurance policy – a standard landlord insurance policy does not provide adequate cover. HMO insurance policies provide public liability insurance as well as building and contents cover.
When looking for HMO insurance you need o look for a policy that is appropriate for the type of HMO license that you hold e.g. a standard HMO or a large HMO. If you have more than one HMO property it may be possible to add multiple locations to one HMO insurance policy, so shop around when looking for quotes.
The total cost of your HMO insurance will depend on the location, type, and size of your property, as well as the number of tenants and number of households living together. Larger houses in a city with more than two households will have a higher premium as they will be seen as more likely to present a risk. HMO inspection In the same way that any landlord would carry out an inspection of their property, an HMO landlord is also required to do the same. Under the Housing, Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS), HMOs are required to have an inspection.
As HMO properties are also considered to be a higher risk, they are also subject to additional regulations to protect the tenants. These include Management of HMO Regulations 2006 and 2007 and Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.
There is a formal list of 29 hazards that an HMO landlord should be checking for in their HMO property that fall under these categories:
Dampness or excess of cold or heat
Pollutants such as asbestos, carbon monoxide, or lead
Lack of space, security or lighting, or exposure to excessive noise
Poor hygiene, lack of and condition of sanitation, sufficient clean water supply
Accidents that could be caused by falls, electric shocks, fires, burns, scalds
Risk of collisions, explosions, or structural collapse FAQs How do you get an HMO license?
To get an HMO license you will need to apply on the  gov.uk website . You will need to have specific paperwork about your property in order to apply.

Gas vs electric heat cost – which is cheaper?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/gas-vs-electric-heat-cost-which-is-cheaper/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Gas vs electric heat cost – which is cheaper?

In This Blog: Cost comparison between gas and electric heating Gas vs electric heat cost FAQs When comparing gas vs electric heat cost, you’re probably keen to know which is cheaper.
On the face of it, gas is cheaper than electric if you’re simply comparing the unit cost (in this case, the cost per kWh). Gas costs 
4.65p/kWh
 and electric costs 
16p/kWh
.
However, while cost per unit is a really important element to consider, there are many other things to weigh up before deciding which type of heating is right for you.
Please note that the UK wholesale energy market is currently in crisis with the current global surge in demand. The energy price cap has already risen by more than 50% and will potentially rise again later this year. 
As such, it is not possible to accurately estimate the cost of energy usage at this time (February 2022). However, we will keep this cost guide updated and estimate the costs again once the market has settled (prices last edited December 2021).

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Cost comparison between gas and electric heating Our table of costs allows you to calculate the cost of gas heating and electric heating per kWh, plus the average installation cost for each type of system.
The unit cost of gas heating is cheaper than electric, at 
4.65p/kWh
, vs 
16p/kWh for electricity
.
However, the average  cost to install a gas central heating system  is around 
£5,250
, compared with 
£3,790
 to install an electric heating system. Gas vs electric heat cost When comparing electric heat vs gas heat cost, you should factor in all the costs associated with each option to make an informed decision.
Unit cost
The unit cost is the cost of the actual fuel itself, be it gas or electric.
The unit cost of gas heating is 
4.65p/kWh. 
The unit cost of electricity is 
16p/kWh
.
Standing-charge
The standing-charge is a fixed daily amount you have to pay for energy regardless of how much you use. It covers the costs your energy supplier takes on in order to supply you with gas or electricity.
The cost of your standing charge will vary depending on your supplier and where you live. As a guide, you can expect to pay:
Electricity standing-charge: 
5p – 60p per day
Gas standing-charge: 
10p – 80p per day

Cost of installation
If you’re switching from one type of energy to another, you’ll need to add in the cost of installing the components to facilitate the particular type of fuel.
For gas, you’ll need a boiler, pipework, and radiators. For electricity, you’ll need plug-in heaters or  storage heaters  in every room. You can have your  electric heaters hardwired to the mains by a professional electrician . It’s worth noting that due to the advances in electric fuel, more people are now choosing this as a means to heat their homes.
The cost of installation will vary depending on the size of your property and the complexity of the job, but on average:
To install a gas central heating system can cost around 
£5,250
To install an electric heating system can cost around 
£3,790

Energy efficiency
As well as being carbon-neutral, another reason why electric has grown in popularity is its efficiency. Electric heating is 100% efficient – every watt of energy used by the heater is converted into heat.
Conversely, with gas central heating, up to 50% of the heat produced by a boiler can be lost through the pipes.
Heat management
With electric heating, you’ll often have thermostatic controls on each heater, meaning you can control which rooms you want to heat, reducing your heating costs. Smart electric heaters are controlled by an app, making this really quick and easy to do.
Gas central heating has a central control to which all the radiators are connected. Therefore you heat your entire home regardless of which rooms you’re using, which will cost more.
Maintenance
Once electric heaters are in place, there’s very little maintenance and they do not require servicing.
A gas central heating system, on the other hand, should be  serviced once a year.  Prices normally start at around 
£80
.
Lifespan
Electric heating systems are expected to last much longer than gas central heating systems. Some heaters even offer a lifetime guarantee.
A gas boiler will last around 15 years before it’ll need replacing, which carries a significant cost. A  boiler supply and installation  range from 
£2,000 – £4,000
.
The UK government is striving towards a carbon Net Zero target by 2050, which is something to consider if you’re deciding whether to choose gas or electric. It’s not beyond the realms of possibility that fossil fuel heating systems will be banned by 2025 in order to hit this milestone.

Gas heat is cheaper than electric (
4.65p/kWh
 vs 
16p/kWh 
respectively), however, there are other costs to consider in addition to the basic unit cost of the fuel. The cost of installation and the maintenance costs vary greatly between the two.
Is electric heating more expensive than gas?
Electric heating is more expensive than gas if you only compare the cost per unit of each type of fuel (gas is 
4.65p/kWh
, but electricity costs 
16p/kWh
). However, it is more expensive to install a gas central heating system (
£5,250
) than an electric heating system (
£3,790
).

How can I futureproof my plumbing and heating business for a low-carbon economy?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-can-i-futureproof-my-plumbing-and-heating-business-for-a-low-carbon-economy/,Tag Not Found,"How can I futureproof my plumbing and heating business for a low-carbon economy?

With net zero firmly on the agenda, the demand for low-carbon domestic heating continues to rise.
From 2025 onwards, gas boilers will no longer be installed in new homes, while the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) will encourage more homeowners to opt for renewable heating technology using heat pumps. There are also green sources of fuel, such as hydrogen and electricity, that will become increasingly popular for powering heating systems.
As a result, businesses in these sectors will need to know how to install new technologies if they want to guarantee a steady flow of work in the future.
Only got a few minutes to spare? No problem, head down to the FAQs section for a quick overview.
Challenges in the plumbing industry
To reach net-zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2050, there will need to be a massive change in the way we heat our homes and other buildings. According to the Climate Change Committee, the built environment accounts for around 17% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions, so even minor adjustments will have a big impact.
The government has committed to replacing the traditional gas boiler in place of more sustainable alternatives. To make sure your business stays ahead of the curve, you will have to invest time and money to get familiar with low-carbon heating systems and their different installation requirements.
This will rely on the plumbing industry having the correct training and information available, which is why this guide serves to point you in the right direction and brush up your knowledge.
Training 
First of all, gaining accreditation from Microgeneration Accreditation Scheme (MCS) is vital for assuring clients that your work meets industry standards. This will also come in very handy for attracting more business not just because of quality assurance, but also due to the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI)
The RHI is a government scheme that encourages homeowners to purchase and install more renewable heating systems. It pays owners of eligible renewable heating systems for the energy they generate and reimburses the owner for up to 80% of the upfront installation cost over seven years. For this reason, acquiring MCS accreditation will attract more opportunities as homeowners need to hire MCS installers to qualify for the RHI.
Industry-Led Training Programmes 
There are several industry courses that will be really valuable for enhancing your skills and knowledge in this new market. The  BEIS Skills Training Competition , for example, is a programme that tradespeople can apply to for free or subsidised training. It covers home energy retrofitting and low-carbon heat installation. Institutions such as CIBSE and CIPHE are also providing low-carbon training courses for tradespeople to upskill themselves for the future.

Heat pumps
Heat pumps provide low-carbon heating by transferring heat from a source outside of the home into the property. Their primary function is space heating through radiators or underfloor heating systems, but can also be used to heat water for use in a home or other building.
Heat pumps are low-temperature systems so they need a larger surface area and higher flow rate to achieve enough heat output. You’ll need to be able to advise homeowners on whether their radiators are of an appropriate size for a heat pump to be installed – if not, the system won’t be able to perform properly. For help on this, check out our blog  here . Making accurate heat loss calculations for each room will also help.
Due to their low heat output, heat pumps are unable to heat water instantaneously and need a hot water storage cylinder for support. This means you’ll need to factor in the space a pump and cylinder take up, as well as some room around them to ensure their work effectively. ASHPs, for example, need access to outdoor air, so the inlets cannot be restricted by other objects.
When retrofitting, the storage cylinder will need to be deemed suitable for a heat pump, as the cylinders found in traditional boiler systems tend to be inefficient and may lack the coil size required to transfer enough heat. In this case, you may need to install a low-temperature-ready unit.
Keep in mind, you’ll need to assess the required pipe size when designing a system. Many newer homes contain microbore pipework that may not be able to provide sufficient water flow for heat transfer. In these circumstances, additional equipment or replacement pipework may be needed.
Hydrogen boilers
Hydrogen fuel is an abundant, carbon-free alternative to natural gas, which is why heating manufacturers are starting to design hydrogen-ready boilers. A hydrogen boiler is very similar to a natural gas boiler, but it does burn differently so there will be some design changes inside the boiler itself.
On the whole, hydrogen boilers could be installed and connected to the network in much the same way. Only a few components would need to change, such as the flame detector and burner. The installation process will also be fairly similar, with no extra space or equipment required. It should be fairly straightforward to get yourself familiarised with this type of system.
District heating networks
This involves supplying heat from a central source to a number of homes via a network of underground pipes carrying hot water, avoiding the need for individual boilers or electric heaters in every building.
There are several ways you can provide the input to a heat network. Anything from power stations and fuel cells, to heat pumps and electric boilers would work.
Heat is brought into each building through a ‘heat exchanger’, which is about the same size as a small gas boiler. Some heat networks will include a heat interface unit (HIU) within each property. HIUs are the bridge between the heat network and the individual property.
District heating is already quite common, with over 17,000 networks already installed in the UK. They will continue to be a popular way to heat buildings, especially as the latest generation is matched to lower flow temperatures generated from renewable heat sources. You can read more about them  here .
FAQs
What’s new in the plumbing industry?
Sustainability is becoming more important to both the government and consumers, and the plumbing industry is beginning to follow suit. Research shows people are more conscious of their purchasing habits nowadays and seek out products that can help the planet as well as their finances, so your business must adapt quickly to capitalise on the demand.
What is a low-carbon heating system?
Simply put, a low-carbon heating system allows heat to be generated with a renewable source and produces less greenhouse gas emissions as a result.
When are gas boilers being banned? 
New gas boiler installations aren’t expected to be banned outright before 2035, so you can still fit them in a customer’s home if they request a replacement unit. However, this may change in the future so keep an eye on the news. That said, gas boilers are set to be phased out from all new build homes from 2025.
What new heating technologies do I need to be aware of? 
The government plans to install 600,000 heat pumps every year up to 2028 so expect to see more demand for this technology from your customers, especially with the Renewable Heat Incentive providing financial support.
While not quite ready to roll out, hydrogen fuel is fast becoming an alternative to traditional gas. There are already trials taking place and most manufacturers now have a model than can run solely on hydrogen or blended with natural gas.

How to start a hot tub installation company,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-start-a-hot-tub-installation-company/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a hot tub installation company

People are always looking for ways to add some luxury to their home, so it’s no wonder hot tubs are such a popular feature nowadays. In 2020 alone, demand rose by over 1000% as many sought to make the most of their outdoor space during lockdown.
But not just anyone can install a hot tub. It takes professional knowledge and skill to get them up and running, and customers need regular maintenance and support to keep them in top working condition. As such, now is a perfect time to set up your own hot tub installation business and make the most of rising demand.
Of course, going solo can be a daunting prospect, which is why this guide will take you through exactly how to start a hot tub installation business and reap the rewards.
Only got five minutes to spare? Head down to the FAQs section at the bottom of this page for some quick answers to the most common queries.
Do I need qualifications to start a hot tub installation business?
Having the right qualifications is really important for any startup. These credentials show potential customers that you have developed professional skills in the industry, which will encourage them to hire your services.
Along with a reliable reputation, qualifications will give you the skills needed to provide high-quality service and follow best practice. Hot tubs involve a good deal of electrical work to set up, so you’ll ideally have completed an electrician course such as:
Level 2 Diploma in Access to Building Services Engineering (Electrical)
Level 2 and Level 3 Diploma in Electrical Installation
T Level in Building Services Engineering for Construction
Installation and maintenance electrician advanced apprenticeship
What skills are important for starting a hot tub installation company? 
Going self-employed means you’ll face challenges both on the job and when running your business. Here are the most important qualities for managing your new hot tub installation company:
For wiring the hot tub circuits, electrical know-how will be essential
Building knowledge is needed to ensure the foundations and location are right for the hot tub
You’ll need to be physically fit for laying down the hot tub as it’s a heavy unit
Dexterity is crucial for fitting the hot tub parts properly
You should have a good idea of the rules and regulations for hot tubs to make sure installations are legal
Interpersonal skills will be key for building client relationships and providing a high standard of customer service
Basic understanding of maths is a must for managing your business finances and working out quotes for customers
What equipment do I need for hot tub installations?
The quality of your work won’t just depend on having the right skills. Without proper equipment, you’ll end up cutting corners and leave clients with work that isn’t up to scratch. That’s why investing in an inventory of high-quality tools will make your life easier and help you build a solid reputation among customers.
Here are all the essentials for hot tub installation equipment:
Level
Tape measure
Cleaning products
Water testing kit
Power drill
PVC cutter
Fish tape
Wirecutter
Pliers
Shovels
Screwdrivers
With the amount of equipment required, you’ll need a way to transport all of it between jobs. That’s why owning a van is also essential for your business.  Signing up to Checkatrade  is a great way to cut costs when purchasing a van for your business. For instance, you can save up to 46% off a Fiat van through member benefits.

There are several areas to cover if you’re going to set your business up properly.
Registration
First of all, you’ll have to register your business with HMRC and state your structure. As a limited company, you’ll have the benefits of better financial security and less tax to deal with. Despite these advantages it’s also worth considering sole trading, especially if you’re sure you won’t need to bring in team members. This structure can be an easier route when starting your business as there’s less paperwork to worry about.
That said, hot tub installation usually requires extra labour for heavy lifting and general support. For more information on the pros and cons when choosing your business structure, read our guide  here .
Insurance
In the rare instance that a customer is left unhappy with your service or you make a mistake, you’re going to need protection from legal fees. In these cases, having hot tub business insurance will be really important for covering all bases. Here are the main types of insurance to consider: Public liability insurance  – Protects your business against customer claims if they believe you’ve damaged their property as a result of your work
Employers’ liability insurance – If you hire employees, you’re legally required to have them covered with this insurance policy Professional indemnity insurance  – Covers you in the event you make a mistake that causes the customer financial loss
Tools insurance – Covers the cost of replacing your tools if they’re lost or damaged due to flooding, theft or fire. Click  here  for more information on keeping your tools safe.
Business plan
Preparation is key when starting a business, so you’ll need to put together a solid plan that covers the ins and outs of your service. You want your business to suit your skills and expertise but also stand out from the competition, so keep these things in mind when outlining your service.
For example, if you have construction skills alongside your ability to wire hot tubs, you could offer to lay foundations as part of your hot tub installation service. Alternatively, you can use your experience with hot tubs to provide a comprehensive service that includes accessory installations and regular maintenance. By applying these ideas to your business plan, you’ll have the potential to establish a profitable niche and attract more clients.
Pricing
A fair pay rate will be important for securing business opportunities. If you set your prices too high, potential customers will look elsewhere. But if you go too low on your pay rates, you’ll be struggling to generate profit for your business.
It’s best to scout out the price ranges of your competitors so you can find a balance and set a competitive pay rate going forward. If you’re looking to offer hot tub maintenance as part of your service and you’re not sure what to charge, you can check out our article  here  for some ballpark figures.
Finances 
The only way you’ll know if your business is profitable is by keeping a close eye on the numbers, so you’ll need to make a habit of checking the ingoings and outgoings.
Being aware of your cashflow will allow you to have a good idea of how your business is performing and see where you might need to make some financial adjustments.
In the beginning, you may find yourself operating at a loss due to the upfront costs of equipment, insurance and registration. If this is a concern, you could consider taking out a business loan to cover the costs while you get up and running. Just remember to watch out for the interest rates.
Along with transactions, you should also keep on top of your taxes. There are several taxes that’ll apply to your business, so it’s important to understand what you should be filing on a regular basis. If you’re struggling to get your head around it all, or need some extra help documenting them, you could always hire an accountant. For more information on accountancy services, read our handy guide  here .
Marketing
When starting a business, it’s vital that you take steps to attract more customers and grow your client base. This means you’ll need to use marketing strategies that promote your start-up effectively.  Becoming a Checkatrade member  is a great way to do exactly that. While you might traditionally rely on word-of-mouth recommendations, Checkatrade allows you to build an online portfolio that displays your customer recommendations for all to see. This way, you can really enhance your reputation and make sure your business is being advertised to a wide audience of over three million monthly site users.
As online presence is so important for any business nowadays, you should consider setting up your own website that potential customers can access as a source of information and contact details. Creating profiles on social media can likewise prove very useful as you’ll be opening up your business to new audiences – plus you can segment your targets. You’ll also be able to drum up new business and develop client relationships by interacting with users and showcasing your best work.
It’s worth keeping in mind print marketing too. This is great for attracting local business, which will save you time and money on travel in the long run. You could distribute leaflets around surrounding neighbourhoods to raise your profile in the area.
Make sure you set up and trade in an area where there’s plenty of opportunities. It makes no sense targeting homeowners who have small gardens where a hot tub won’t fit. That said, there are a range of products designed for urban living, so think about how you can offer these if you’re based in densely populated area like London or Manchester.
FAQs
Do you need an electrician to install a hot tub? 
Under Part P of Building Regulations, it’s a legal requirement to have all electrical wiring work carried out by a fully qualified electrician. Seeing as hot tubs include electrical wiring, installation will need to be completed by someone with electrician qualifications.
What is the average cost to install a hot tub?
If the hot tub only needs basic electrical work to be installed, this will usually cost between £100 to £350. But, if you have to factor in delivery, new wiring and accessories this may add up to significantly more. In these scenarios, the price can vary from around £750 to £2000.

With homes throughout the country using a large amount of energy every day, the impact on our environment is significant. Coupled with the terrible energy efficiency of most homes, this means a high amount of emissions as well as a lot of wasted power. A brilliant way of counteracting this is to buy or transform your current home into a Passive House. But 
how much do Passive Houses cost?
Let’s start by looking at what exactly a Passive House is. Energy-efficient, with low emissions, Passive Houses are good news for the environment. They also offer high levels of comfort for a fraction of the energy needed to heat a normal house. What’s more, living in a Passive House is great for your mental and physical health.
In order to be classed as a Passive House, a property has to meet the  Passivehaus standard . Going beyond building regulations, sticking to these standards means reduced energy bills and an eco-friendlier home. The standards cover everything from insulation to energy recovery ventilation and construction methods. Benefits of a Passive House Deciding to upgrade your home to Passive House standards is one of the best ways to support Mother Nature. In fact, there are quite a few different benefits of living in a Passive House.
These include:
Health
: The air you breathe in your Passive House will be much cleaner and fresher, great for your health.
No mould
: Choosing a Passive House means you won’t need to worry about mould building up throughout your home. This is due to Passive Homes having lower relative humidity, ensuring the air is dryer and preventing mould from growing.

This means the average passive house cost can be quite high. However, with the savings you’ll make on energy bills, you’ll recover your money over time.
Based on a 150m2 home, the 
average Passive House price is £322,500. Factors affecting Passivhaus costs Of course, the cost to build a Passive house will vary, depending on a range of different factors. Some of the factors affecting the cost of your Passivhaus will include:
Size
: The larger your home, the higher the cost.
Location
: Homes in different locations in the UK will be priced differently.
Starting condition
: Depending on the condition of your home at the start of the conversion process, you may need to invest more or less for improvements.
Finish
: Choosing a higher quality finish for your Passivhaus will increase the cost.
Furniture and appliances
: You may decide to invest in better quality appliances or furniture which will add to the Passivhaus cost you pay.
Supplies:
 Depending on how easy it is to source materials and supplies your Passivhaus cost will vary.
If you’re on a tight budget but still want to do your part to help the environment, there are a few ways to reduce your cost to build a Passive House. These include:
Picking a simpler design
Adding extra insulation to your home’s roof and slab
Ensuring your windows are positioned to make the most of the sunlight
Making your ventilation pipes shorter

Find the builders your neighbours recommend  Passive house cost per square foot As we mentioned above, the amount you pay for your Passive House will largely depend on the size of the property.
When you’re budgeting, it may be handy to know the average Passive House cost per square foot. Well, this will still vary but generally, you can 
expect to pay anything from £139 to £362. Passive House cost per m2 When planning to upgrade your home to a Passive House you’ll need to set a budget for what you can afford. Remember, while the price you pay may be quite high, you’ll make huge savings on your energy bills.
For reference, the 
average Passive House cost per m2 will usually fall between £1,500 and £3,900. Passive House certification cost In order for your home to qualify as a Passive House, you’ll need to meet the standards set out and apply for certification. In addition, you’ll need to pay for your Passive House to be assessed, which can be quite costly. The 
average Passive House certification cost is £1,500
. Building close to the Passivhaus standards Many people are looking to reap the rewards that come with owning a Passivhaus but simply can’t afford the extensive renovations necessary. That’s why some homeowners choose to build close to the Passivhaus standards without going over their budgets. You’ll still enjoy a range of benefits for a more affordable price.
The 
average cost to
build close to the Passivhaus standard is £2,000 per m2
. Considering upgrading to a Passive House? If you want to make a positive impact on your environment and reap the health benefits that come with owning a Passive House, you’ll need to make a few home improvements. These should be completed by a qualified tradesperson to ensure the job is done efficiently and to a high standard.

How to replace a light switch,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/replace-light-switch/,Living Room,"How to replace a light switch

In This Blog: How to replace a light switch How to replace a double light switch How to replace a light switch with a dimmer How to replace a 3 way light switch How to replace a pull cord light switch FAQs Learning how to replace a light switch might seem simple. However, these practical items come in various shapes, sizes, and materials with different functionalities. If you’re hoping to replace one yourself, you might be looking to upgrade from a plain design to a more stylish model. Alternatively, you might be hoping to swap an existing switch to a dimmer or double control panel that lets you manage your lighting more easily.
Although changing a light switch is relatively simple, working with electronics comes with various risks. That’s why it’s always worth  hiring a professional . If you’re looking to do it yourself, read on for our top tips and expert advice.
Check out our  cost to replace a light switch  guide for information on pricing up your project. How to replace a light switch Types of light switch
There are several types of light fittings or ‘plate switches’ that have one to three (or more) switches (aka gangs) on a panel. There are also two or multi-way switches that allow you to control more than one light. And when it comes to fittings, there are various plastic, metal, or stylized options on the market. The same goes for dimmer options, which are wired in a similar way to standard switches. For most ceiling-mounted pull-cord switches, building regulations stipulate that they’re installed in shower rooms, wetrooms, or bathrooms.
Tools you’ll need for the job
Screwdriver to unscrew the light switch plates
Grounding strap
Circuit tester
Electrical tape
Wire cutters/strippers
Wire nut How to replace a double light switch Follow these steps if you’ve asked yourself, ‘how do I remove a light switch and replace it?’
Step one: Turn off the power
Electricity is dangerous and requires turning off in case you accidentally hurt yourself. This goes for wiring small items like a double light switch, so make sure you locate the electrical panel that feeds your entire home and turn off the power. This should be easy if you have breakers that are labelled correctly. However, if you’re unsure, turn the main power off just to be on the safe side.
Step two: Double-check the current isn’t live
Take off the faceplate on the light switch you want to replace using your screwdriver. Then, put on your grounding strap and put the other end on the metal in the box. Keep it there while you use your circuit tester to make sure there’s no electricity by pressing the contacts to each wire, including the space between wires. Once you’ve established there’s no current, continue to step three. If there is still a charge, go back to step one.
Step three: Identify each wire
Most light switches have three wires: hot (red or black) neutral (white), and grounding (bare, green, yellow or green and yellow stripes). For double switches, there will be multiple wires that go to each light fixture and one to the breaker box. Put some electrical tape around each individual hot wire (this is so you can identify them later) then group the rest of the wires coming from the wall box by their colours. Use some electrical tape to secure them (neutrals together and grounding together, etc.)
Step four: Strip the wires
Once you’ve isolated your groups, take your wire cutters and strip the insulation from each end of every grouped wire. Twist the bare ends and ‘cap’ them together with an electrical wire nut.
Step five: Connect the double light switch
Once your wires are capped, loosen (but don’t pull out!) the screws on the double light switch. This will reveal the old wire connections on the double light switch that you want to mimic with the new connections. To do this, wrap the ends of the hot wires (the ungrouped ones you wrapped in electrical tape) around the screws. You’ll also need to attach:
the breaker box hot wire to the black terminal screw; and
the hot wires leading to the light fixtures to the other two terminal screws.
Once you’ve wrapped the hot wires around their relevant terminal screws, tighten them up and secure the new switches to the switch box. Now all you need to do is replace your faceplate, turn the power back on, and test out your handiwork!

Hire the electrician your neighbours recommend  How to replace a light switch with a dimmer If you’re looking to replace your standard switch with a dimmer switch, these five simple steps will help:
Locate the circuit or fuse panel and make sure the power is turned off.
Remove the switch plate by unscrewing it and make sure the circuit is dead by testing it with your voltage tester.
Pull out the switch with the wires still attached by unscrewing it from the electrical box, then remove the wires from the old switch.
Dimmer switches tend to be connected to the house wiring instead of screw terminals. This means short lengths of wire come out of the switch body instead, making them an easier swap.
Most new fixtures come with wire nuts, so use them to attach the black wires coming out of the dimmer switch to the coloured wires attached to the terminals on the old switch. How to replace a 3 way light switch Three-way switches are handy when it comes to controlling light from two locations. For example, at the top and bottom of a staircase. Strangely, three-way light switches only apply to two switches that control one light. The ‘three’ refers to the three terminal screws these switches have.
Follow these steps to learn how to replace a 3-way light switch:
Locate the circuit or fuse panel and make sure the power is turned off.
Remove the switch plate by unscrewing it, then make sure the circuit is dead by testing it with your voltage tester.
Pull out the switch with the wires still attached by unscrewing it from the electrical box, then remove the wires from the old switch.
It’s worth noting that three-way switches have a minimum of three wires – four if there’s a ground wire. There will be two wires that attach to screw terminals (generally located at the top of the switch) and an additional wire attached to a dark-coloured (that isn’t green) screw terminal usually located at the bottom of the switch. This is the one you want to mark with a piece of electrical tape. 
Note:
Make sure you mark it on the same side as the switch directly above it using different-coloured tape.
Once you’ve tagged your wires, attach them to the corresponding terminals of the new switch. Alternatively, consider transferring one wire at a time if that’s easier.
If the current switch has a ground wire that’s green, then either attach the wire to the green screw terminal on the new switch or onto the electrical box.
Once you’ve finished wiring your new switch, push it back into the electrical box and screw it in place.
The final step is to screw on the switch plate and turn on the power.
Note:
Your replacement switch might have electrical screw connectors located in slightly different areas to the switch you’re replacing. However, most switches include a pair of terminals on opposite sides of the switch top with a single terminal at the bottom.

Hire the electrician your neighbours recommend  How to replace a pull cord light switch If your pull cord in your bathroom is discoloured or broken, it’s time to fix it. Thankfully, they’re quick and easy to replace, and you can buy one from most DIY shops.
To replace the pull cord, follow these steps:
Turn off the electrics in your house
Stand on a step ladder you’ve firmly secured
Find the clip at the top of the string, which will be near to the switch on the ceiling where it enters.
Unclip the worn pull cord and discard.
Clip your new cord into the fitting.
Turn back on your electrics.
Test that the new pull cord works and that the fit is secure. FAQs Can I replace a light switch myself?
If you’re a confident DIY’er, there’s no reason you can’t change a light switch yourself following our steps above. However, if you’re in any way unsure, we recommend filling in our  request a quote form  to get quotes from electricians near you.
Do you need an electrician to change a switch?
If you’re wondering whether you should  hire an electrician  or do the job yourself, we recommend assessing the job at hand and working out whether it requires a complex or simple solution. For a quick, safe, and secure fit, it’s worth spending a little extra to ensure a professional job.
When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews. Even better, those reviews are from your neighbours and checked by us to make sure they’re legitimate.

Laminate or wood flooring: What should you go for?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/laminate-or-wood-flooring/,"Kitchen, Living Room","Laminate or wood flooring: What should you go for?

In This Blog: Laminate vs wood – what’s best for your home? Engineered wood vs laminate flooring pros and cons Laminate vs hardwood Hiring a professional Which tradesperson should I use? Creating your dream home is never easy as there are so many different choices to make. But when it comes to flooring, if you’re sure that carpet isn’t for you, you’re probably weighing up if you’d like laminate or wood flooring.
Both can totally transform your living space but there are differences between the two. Laminate flooring is crafted by layering fibreboard, a photographic layer and a topcoat, while wood flooring is made from solid timber boards. There are differences in the installation process too, with laminate flooring easily clicking together whilst wood flooring has to be nailed in place.
There are differences in the way they look too. Wooden floors (unsurprisingly) look more natural and can be stained to the tone you like, whilst laminate flooring you can pick exactly what you would like before having it fitted. Read on for more tips and comparisons to help you choose your new flooring. Laminate vs wood – what’s best for your home? In order to decide which material is better for your home, we need to look at the pros and cons of both laminate and wood flooring. Below we’ve summarised the advantages and disadvantages of each type of flooring:
Laminate flooring
Advantages
: More affordable, more durable, low maintenance
Disadvantages: 
Can be damaged by too much moisture, reduced lifespan, more difficult to repair or replace
Wood flooring
Advantages
: Can easily be repaired, visually stunning, increases the value of your home, long lasting
Disadvantages
: Easier to damage and more expensive
If you have pets or children, laminate flooring is more durable so may be a better choice. In addition, if you’re on a budget, laminate is much more affordable. On the other hand, wood flooring looks incredible and can be repaired if it does become damaged. Engineered wood vs laminate flooring pros and cons If you love the appearance of wood flooring but hate the high price tag, engineered wood flooring may be a great alternative. Unlike laminate, engineered wood is made up of a thin layer of hardwood on top of a layer of plywood.
Looking at the below pros and cons of engineered wood vs laminate flooring is a great way of comparing the two materials:
Engineered wood
Pros: 
More authentic, has a lifespan of over 30 years
Cons: 
More easily damaged, harder to install
Laminate flooring
Pros: 
More affordable, easier to install,
Cons:
 Shorter lifespan of 10 – 20 years, difficult to replace a single board
Hopefully, this should help you to choose laminate or engineered wood flooring, but the decision really comes down to your circumstances both financial and lifestyle. Laminate vs hardwood For a truly natural feel to your home, it may be worth considering hardwood flooring. Where engineered wood has a thin layer of hardwood, hardwood flooring is made of boards of solid timber. This helps to add value to your property as well as add style to your living space.
So, let’s compare laminate vs hardwood:
Laminate flooring
Advantages:
 Inexpensive, easily clicks together, easy to maintain, water and stain resistant
Disadvantages:
 Less authentic, shorter lifespan
Hardwood flooring
Advantages:
 Natural and authentic appearance, longer lifespan, considered more prestigious
Disadvantages
: Harder to install, can be easily damaged by moisture Hiring a professional For the best results, we always recommend hiring a flooring professional for both laminate and wooden flooring. While you may be able to attempt a DIY job (more so with laminate flooring), remember that any mistakes can be expensive and very time consuming to fix.
You can find flooring specialists that your neighbours recommend simply by entering your postcode into our  online search . All tradespeople are checked by us, reviewed by your neighbours, then checked by us again (so you know the reviews are real). Even better, we now offer a  guarantee  in the unlikely event something goes wrong with your job (T&Cs apply).

How to remove a scratch from your car in 3 steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/remove-scratch-from-car/,Garage,"How to remove a scratch from your car in 3 steps

In This Blog: How to remove a scratch on your car How to remove a deep scratch from a car  How to remove scratch marks from a car interior How to remove a key scratch from a car How to remove a scratch from a car window  FAQs Want to know how to remove a scratch on a car? We feel your pain, and we’ve got you covered.
In some cases, for example, if you need to remove a deep scratch from a car, it’s often best left to the professionals for the best finish. But there are times when you can try the DIY approach at home.
In just a few simple steps, we’ll show you how to restore your paintwork in no time. How to remove a scratch on your car If you’re looking for how to remove a small scratch from a car, the good news is you may be able to fix this yourself using a DIY scratch repair kit or, wait for it, a humble tube of toothpaste!
There are three layers of paintwork on your car, made up of primer, base coat, and a clear coat. 
If the scratch on your car is so deep that you can see the metal panel beneath these three layers, always 
contact a professional car body repair specialist
.
For scratches that have cut through the clear coat and onto the base coat, you’ll likely need a car scratch repair kit.
If the scratch has only affected the clear topcoat, reach for the toothpaste.
Tools and materials to remove a scratch from your car at home
Toothpaste (whitening toothpaste works best), or a car scratch repair kit
Warm water, soap, and sponge
Two clean microfibre cloths
The 3 easy steps to remove a small car scratch
Step 1
Before you tackle the scratch, wash the scratched area with warm, soapy water to remove any dirt or debris. This will make sure you don’t scratch the paintwork further in the next step. Next, rinse the area, and dry with a clean cloth.
Step 2
If using toothpaste, squeeze 2p’s worth of paste onto a damp microfibre cloth.
If using a scratch repair kit, you may be supplied with a buffing pad or tool. Apply the scratch removal solution to the buffing pad (again, about 2p worth in size should be sufficient).
Whether you’re using toothpaste or a scratch repair kit, you then need to rub the product into the affected area using a smooth, circular motion and a small amount of pressure. It’s important to keep the motion going in the same direction to get even coverage.
Step 3
Next, take a clean microfibre cloth and wipe away any excess product. Rinse and dry the area.
Repeat the process if necessary.
Tip: make sure you read the manufacturer’s instructions before reapplying the scratch removal agent. Over-application could damage the clear coat of your paintwork.
If you’ve followed the above steps and the scratch hasn’t disappeared, then do call in a professional. More work will be needed to get rid of the scratch.
A professional car body repair specialist will charge around 
£60 – £100 
to repair a minor surface layer car scratch. It is possible to have a mobile car body repair specialist visit you at home to fix the scratch. This usually costs in the region of 
£80 – £210
.
Many mobile car body repair specialists now offer SMART scratch repair. Check out our post on the  cost of car scratch repair  to learn more about this technology, and the cost of other repairs, such as scratched alloy wheels and repairing stone chips.

How to clean solar panels,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/clean-solar-panels/,Roof,"How to clean solar panels

In This Blog: How to clean solar panels on a roof How to clean solar panels from the ground How to clean solar panels on garden lights  How to clean flexible solar panels How to clean solar panels glass How to clean algae off solar panels How to clean bird poop off solar panels  FAQs Solar panels are a great source of natural energy, letting you power your home in a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly way. You can even make money from your solar panels by selling the excess energy generated to the National Energy Grid.
However, as with many other installations in and around the home, you need to know how to clean your solar panels and  maintain  them. This will ensure maximum efficiency, improve their performance, and increase their lifespan. How to clean solar panels on a roof Before attempting to clean your solar panels, there are a couple of important considerations: 
Working at height in a wet and slippery environment can be incredibly dangerous. We always recommend calling in a professional for cleaning roof-mounted solar panels.
Cleaning your solar panels with the wrong tools or cleaning materials could invalidate your solar panel warranty.
A professional solar panel cleaner has the necessary training and equipment to carry out this task safely for you. On average,  cleaning solar panels  normally costs around 
£9.50 per panel.
You can use our  request a quote  feature to obtain quotes from local solar panel cleaning experts who come highly recommended in your area.

Find solar panel cleaners your neighbours trust  How to clean solar panels from the ground Tools and materials
A soft brush
A squeegee with a plastic blade
A hose or harvested rainwater (especially in hard water areas, as rainwater will leave less residue on the panels)
How to clean solar panels
The best time to clean solar panels is early morning or late evening during spring or summer, preferably on an overcast day. It’s best to avoid cleaning the panels when they’re hot from the sun.
Make sure you turn the power off on the panels and the inverters before cleaning the panels. Check your solar panel instruction booklet for how to do this.
Use a soft brush to remove any loose dirt or debris.
Use your harvested rainwater to wash the panels.
Squeegee the panels. This is especially important if using tap water in a hard water area, as mineral deposits will form on the panels as it dries.
Warning:
 stop cleaning immediately if you notice any damaged cables and report it to your solar panel installer.
How to clean solar panels on garden lights 
We recommend cleaning the solar panels on your garden lights every 2-3 months to maintain their performance.
Use a dry or damp cloth to gently wipe any dirt or dust off the panel. Make sure your cloth is only damp – not wet – as you want to avoid water damaging the electronics within the panel.
For more stubborn grime, add some biodegradable soap to your damp sponge and give the solar panel a scrub. Never use any abrasive cleaners or materials to clean the solar panels on your garden lights, for example, scourers or bleach.
Finally, wipe the solar panel with a clean, damp cloth to remove any soap residue. How to clean flexible solar panels Flexible solar panels are becoming more and more popular. They are made from layers of thin films of photovoltaic (PV) material, which makes them more lightweight and much thinner than traditional solar panels. You might notice them on boats, caravans or campervans, due to their flexibility and portability.
But how do you clean flexible solar panels?
The best way to clean this type of panel is with a soft sponge and biodegradable soap and water. Simply hose the panel down once clean, and dry with a squeegee or clean cloth. How to clean solar panels glass In most cases, the best way to clean solar panel glass is with a soft cloth and biodegradable soap.
Always avoid using harsh materials, such as an abrasive sponge or scourer. This could damage the panel and lead to expensive repairs.
To understand how best to clean your solar panel glass, check your solar panel instruction booklet or contact a professional solar panel cleaner, experienced in this line of work.

Find solar panel cleaners your neighbours trust  How to clean algae off solar panels If your solar panels are installed in an area that’s prone to constant rainfall and a fair amount of shade, you may find algae growing on the panels. This can turn into lichen, which is much harder to remove if left untreated. Therefore regular cleaning will prevent the algae from having the chance to grow in the first place.
So how do you clean algae off solar panels?
Using a soft brush, remove any loose algae from the solar panel.
Gently hose down the panel.
In a spray bottle, mix a solution of 1/2 tsp biodegradable soap, 2 cups water and 1/4 cup vinegar.
Spray the solution onto the solar panels and rub with a clean cloth or sponge.
Wash the panel down to remove any residue and dry with a clean cloth or squeegee.
Make sure you refer to your manufacturer’s instructions before cleaning your solar panels. Failure to use the recommended tools or cleaning materials could invalidate your warranty.
How to clean bird poop off solar panels 
If tree branches overhang your solar panels, you may find an increased amount of bird poop on your solar panels. Much of this will be removed by rainfall.
If nature hasn’t managed to rid the panels of this unsightly deposit, you should be able to remove any remaining poop with a hose. Angle the hose downward rather than creating a pressurised spray directly at the panels.
Remember, if your solar panels are on the roof, we always recommend using the services of a professional solar panel cleaner. 
An expert solar panel cleaner will have the necessary training to safely shut down and restart the solar panel system before and after cleaning. They will also have professional water-fed brushes and non-abrasive chemicals suited to this specialist task.

Find solar panel cleaners your neighbours trust  FAQs What is the best way to clean solar panels?
For roof-mounted solar panels, we always advise you seek the services of a professional solar panel cleaner. For ground-level solar panels, water, a soft sponge and a little biodegradable soap should be sufficient to remove dust and dirt.
Does cleaning your solar panels make a difference?
Yes. Clean solar panels will work more efficiently than those covered in dirt and debris.
How often should solar panels be cleaned?
You may be wondering how often do I need to clean my solar panels? Ideally, your solar panels should be cleaned every six months or so.
Is it ok to pressure wash solar panels?
It is not advisable to use a pressure washer such as a jet hose to wash solar panels. The high-pressure action could damage the panels, lead to costly repairs, and invalidate your warranty

Which tradespeople can remove paint from brick?
Brick paint removal services are normally carried out by an exterior cleaning or restoration firm.
Will a heat gun remove paint from brick?
A heat gun and paint scraper can be an effective method for removing paint.
Warning: 
older paints may contain lead, which when heated will cause fumes that are dangerous to inhale. If using this method on interior brickwork, be careful not to apply too much heat as you can start a fire.
Can I use oven cleaner to remove paint from brick?
While oven cleaner may help to loosen the paint from bricks, it’s unlikely to strip it off to a clean finish.
Does WD-40 remove paint brick?
WD-40 may be able to help you out with dried paint stuck in the crevices of your brickwork. Spray the WD-40 on the paint and use a stiff brush to scrub any stubborn areas.
Does paint thinner remove paint from brick?
Paint thinner can be used to remove paint from brick. It will remove it in layers, working from the topcoat down to the bare brick, therefore you may be presented with challenges where multiple coats have been applied.
Warning: 
the chemicals in paint thinners can leach into soft, porous brick. It can also run off into vegetation and enter groundwater if not properly trapped. Always take the recommended safety precautions when using paint stripper or thinner.

Home trends for 2022,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/home-trends-for-the-future/,Living Room,"Home trends for 2022

In This Blog: Home trends furniture Home colour trends Latest trends in home interiors Latest home design trends Luxury home trends Home automation trends Home security trends FAQs Want to know the latest home trends for 2022? Let’s take a look at the latest trends in home decor for the year ahead.
We’ve had a look forward to what’s looking hot for 2022 and split all the home trends out into the main home trends categories covering everything from furniture, decorating, home security, and a few luxury touches. Home trends furniture Furnishing your home is likely to be one of the biggest decisions you make. Choosing on-trend furniture doesn’t have to cost the earth – financially or  environmentally .
The main home trends for furniture in 2022 are:
Convertible furniture
Minimalism and rounded organic shapes
Natural materials
Sustainability and durability
Whether you are buying new, being thrifty or splurging on bespoke options, there are home furniture trends to suit everyone. Minimalism remains a strong design trend, and for 2022 we’re seeing rounded natural shapes in natural materials like linen, wood and rattan being popular choices for furniture.
Globally we’re seeing a heightened focus on sustainability, so if you’re looking to change up your 2022 design scheme whilst remaining environmentally conscious, you could consider  reupholstering existing or second-hand furniture  to bring a fresh look to your home.
Convertible or multi-purpose furniture pieces are great options for more compact living spaces and are often made with simple lines and from durable natural materials. Home colour trends Home colour trends for 2022 also go along with a more natural vibe.
Top colour trends for 2022 are:
Black accents
Shades of green
Natural warm palette
Calming colours
Black is a colour that creeped its way into the home in 2021, and that looks set to continue for 2022. Matt black hardware in kitchens and bathrooms are making a popular appearance, as are black-painted accents on staircases in hallways.
Green is also a very trendy paint colour choice for 2022. Green could be seen to be a bold choice for a wall colour, but it is possible to introduce flashes of green rather than painting a whole room one colour. Painting the bottom half of a wall including the skirting a darker colour, with the top half of the room remaining a lighter colour adds depth to a room.
Aside from black accents and shades of green, on the whole, the colours that are adorning walls for 2022 are calming, earthy, natural and warm, giving off a clean and cosy feel.

Warm colours in the kitchen
Staying with the natural theme, the latest trends in home interiors show that light coloured flooring is in, whether that is natural wood flooring, laminate or vinyl. They say that the kitchen is the heart of the home, and for 2022 kitchen decor is all about warmth and earthy colours, from neutral shades of cream through to rich browns and terracotta. To bring your home up to date with the latest trends in home interiors, it can be as simple as getting a new colour on your walls. Latest home design trends Work from home spaces Outdoor rooms With many more people working from home, unsurprisingly one of the home design trends for 2022 includes designated spaces for home working. If you’re short on space think about creating a multi-functional work zone in an existing room. The use of colour on your walls is a great way to designate this space in a cost-effective way. If you have more space to play with then garden rooms are still big for 2022.
These make perfect work from home spaces to keep work out of your living space or make a cosy spot for relaxation or enjoyment of your hobbies.
For more inspiration, take a look at our  garden rooms guide . Luxury home trends For those of us with a little more room, or for a taste of the finer things in life here’s what’s hot for 2022:
Formal trends – bring back the dining room
Elements of fantasy, bold prints and one of a kind rooms
Many newer houses favour larger open plan living rooms and kitchens instead of a formal dining room – but the dining room is making a comeback!
Along with it is a move towards creating more theatre in the home and one of a kind statement rooms. Why not combine the two and create your own unique dining room design complete with an eye-catching colour scheme or wallpaper. Whatever your own personal style and taste, changing up the colour and texture on your walls is a quick and easy way to move with the times.

Find decorators your neighbours recommend  Home automation  trends
Nowadays, most of us like to remain connected most of the time, and the same is true for our homes. Some of the techy home trends for 2022 are:
Smart appliances
Voice and gesture activated control
Smart TV’s becoming a hub for home control
Energy efficiency
Smart speakers are already commonplace in many homes and 2022 is set to see that continue with an increase in voice-activated home controls, including our TV’s acting as the main control hub for all the smart devices and technology in the home.
For those of us that are spending more time outside of the home, we can keep a close eye from a distance and remain in control with the help of smart appliances such as ovens and washing machines that can be controlled by apps on our computers or smartphones.
We are all becoming more conscious of our energy consumption, especially with rising costs, and as a result, we will start to see more frequent use of  smart lighting  and the use of occupancy sensors to keep lighting costs down. Home security trends Related to home automation trends, we can also expect to see a continued focus on home security. Technology can be confusing, so combining the control of these smart home systems together can be really helpful.
In 2022 we can expect to see an increase in:
Access control that integrates lighting,  CCTV  and  alarm systems Remote arming and occupancy simulation
For more information read our  home security systems guide . FAQs What are the latest trends in home decorating?
In this blog, we’ve covered what looks to be the latest home trends for 2022 which include warm colour schemes and natural colours and textures.

The cost to build a karate dojo,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/cost-build-karate-dojo/,Garage,"The cost to build a karate dojo

In This Blog: Cost estimates to build your Cobra Kai karate dojo Cost estimates to build your Miyagi-Do karate dojo If you’re pumped for the release of the new ‘Cobra Kai’ series on New Year’s Eve, then check out this ‘cost to build a karate dojo’ guide. And if you’re genuinely wondering how to start your own karate dojo, we can shower you with ideas and help you work out how much building a karate dojo might set you back.
Firstly, whose team are you on in the LaRusso vs Johnny rivalry – Miyagi-Do Karate or Cobra Kai? Maybe a better question here is, which dojo looks cooler?
Cobra Kai and Miyagi-Do Karate have very different vibes, so the type of dojo you want to create will differ depending on your preferences. Cobra Kai is decorated in a militant style with streaks of red, black, and a fierce cobra. On the other hand, Miyagi-Do is an oriental garden with lots of fence panels to practice your wax-on-wax-off defensive blocks.
So, grasshopper, let’s jump into the potential costs for starting your very own Cobra Kai or Miyagi-Do dojo.
Yours, Sensei.

Find conversion experts your neighbours recommend  Cost estimates to build your Cobra Kai karate dojo Johnny Lawrence hires a space and then decorates it, which makes the cost of getting your own Cobra Kai started pretty affordable.
Painting, decorating, and wallpapering costs
One of the first things you’ll need to think about is the  painting and decorating costs . If you want to opt for funky patterns or elaborate cobra  murals , they may cost a little more to paint. However, the average painter/decorator rate is around 
£200 per day
.
Assuming the entire joint needs a fresh lick of paint or it’s a large area with multiple rooms similar to the TV show, getting a realistic cost means pricing it up per m² of floor space, which is similar to the cost of decorating a home. Using these metrics, the price would average 
£45 per m² 
of floor space.
If you have room in your budget, you may even want to paint the exterior of your dojo, which can be priced up using our  exterior painting cost guide .
Flooring costs
Before you open your dojo, you may need to look into the type of flooring. For example, if it’s an old carpet, you may want to replace it with an easy clean and more hygienic option, e.g., concrete or vinyl. Laminate is another option, but with the potential impact force while you’re training, vinyl is a better option and less likely to break. Luxury  vinyl flooring  (LVT) is around 
£45 per m².
On top of the new flooring, you’ll also need soft foam floor mats, which usually cost around 
£45 per m²
.
Cost of putting up mirrors
Cobra Kai plays it cool by going sans-mirrors. However, you may want to hang mirrors on the wall to check your guard and balance. If so, the  cost for your mirrors  is hard to predict. For example, studio mirrors for your home will depend on how professional you want your setup to look. You can purchase sets of portable, professional dance mirrors that cover a whole wall for up to 
£1,400
, but we understand that’s a little pricey. Consequently, your best bet is to speak to a professional.  Speak to a mirror expert  on Checkatrade for further information.
Other potential costs
When you find the perfect location for your dojo, always check the basics such as electrics, heating, windows, and doors.
You may need to budget a little extra for any repairs, replacements, or servicing required. Although you’re teaching tough kids to strike first, strike hard, and with no mercy, you’ll still need power, heating, and air conditioning to keep them warm (especially if you live in the US).
Here’s a list with some potential actions and costs: Boiler service cost : Average 
£75
 per visit New boiler cost : Average 
£6k per boiler + installation fees Central heating installation cost : Average 
£3,790 
for an electric installation Electrical safety check cost : Average 
£225 per check Window shutter installation : Average 
£240 per m²
You may also want to introduce gym equipment, so check out our  home gym cost guide  for more information or our  home gym ideas  for aesthetic inspiration.

Find conversion experts your neighbours recommend  Cost estimates to build your Miyagi-Do karate dojo The Miyagi-Do is entirely different from Johnny’s Cobra Kai. Fortunately for Mr Miyagi and Daniel LaRusso, when Miyagi originally started his dojo, he had available land to transform. If you’re hoping to go down a similar route, you’ll likely require a hefty amount of landscaping to recreate the look. This means you’ll need to design your garden before you begin, then team up with a landscaper who can bring your  oriental garden design  to life.
Here are some of the features you may want to consider for your own Miyagi-Do: Garden design  cost
Embody the tranquillity of the Miyagi-Do by  hiring a professional  to design the perfect training retreat. On average, a garden design cost will range between
 £5,000 – £10,000
 for a transformational project on a large rear garden of 
100m²
. Garden landscaping  cost
If you have the space and you’re looking for some extra help transforming your land, the  cost of a garden landscaper  costs an average of around 
£280 per day
. New fencing  cost
Be a good sensei and keep your grasshoppers safe in the sanctuary of your dojo by installing sturdy wooden fences that stop people spying on your training methods. The average cost of a fence installation is
 £1,400 
while the average cost of fencing panels is 
£36.50
 per panel. Decking  cost
From 
£2,300
 for a non-elevated softwood deck to 
£22,000
 for an elevated composite decking with railing and stairs, you can install a simple or elaborate decking design in your garden. Pond cost Perfect for making wishes or questioning your resilience as you ponder your next move, the cost of a pond ranges from 
£1,200
 for a small garden to 
£15,000
 for a high-end koi pond. Water feature  cost
There’s a variety of water features that inject harmony into your garden available on the market. However, the cost to have one installed depends on the type you choose for your dojo. A small garden pond will usually cost around 
£800
 including a water feature. Alternatively, a larger or luxury option like a pondless waterfall (6 foot) or glass water feature could cost up to 
£10,000
.

How to turn off the water under your sink,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/turn-off-water-under-sink/,"Bathroom, Kitchen","How to turn off the water under your sink

In This Blog: How to turn off the water under your kitchen sink How to turn off the water under your bathroom sink How to turn off the water under the sink with no valve How to turn off the water under the sink if the valve is stuck FAQs Knowing how to turn off the water under your sink is a simple but handy DIY skill that can be useful to know in an emergency, or to undertake household maintenance or renovations.
Needing to know how to turn off the water under your sink doesn’t always have to mean there has been a disaster. Sometimes turning the water off under the sink is simply a practical thing to do for the following reasons:
To install a new kitchen or bathroom
Central heating repairs Prevent or fix a leak As a preventative measure if you are going away
If you are worried about leaking water pipes in your home then it could be worth considering installing an  automatic water shut off valve . This is something that you can discuss with a  local plumber .
Not every home is the same, but in this guide, we’re going to cover a few different options to help you understand how to turn off the water under your sink, should you need or want to. How to turn off the water under your kitchen sink Depending on the reason for turning off the water, the method for how to turn off the water under your kitchen sink might differ.
If you are trying to replace your kitchen tap(s) or carry out maintenance or repairs to your sink then you can simply isolate the taps instead of turning off the water completely. To do this you should see isolation valves for each tap that will be marked red for the hot tap and blue for the cold tap.
Turning the valves clockwise will shut off the water supply to the taps so you can carry out the necessary work you need to. You may need a flathead screwdriver for this task if you are attempting it yourself.
If you need to know to turn off the water under your kitchen sink completely then you need to locate the internal stop tap, also called the stop valve or stop cock. It usually looks like a spoutless tap and is attached to a length of pipe. Occasionally the valve can also be plastic or be shaped like a small wheel.
In most homes, this stop tap can be found under your kitchen sink, but in some properties, it can also be found in an airing cupboard if there is one, or even under the floorboards near the front door.
Once you have located your internal stop tap, turning it clockwise will close the valve. It can take a couple of minutes for the water flow to stop completely. Make sure to turn the tap slowly and without too much force. If you over-tighten the tap you may struggle to loosen it again or cause damage to the tap.
If your stop tap is too stiff to turn or isn’t shutting off the water then you need to call a plumber.

Find a plumber your neighbours recommend  How to turn off the water under your bathroom sink Knowing how to turn off the water under your bathroom sink is a very similar process. The only main difference is how easy it is to access the pipework and stop tap. If you have exposed pipework that is enclosed by an under-sink cupboard then this should be fairly easy.
If you have a sink with a pedestal then you will need to remove this to access the pipework and locate the stop tap. This is a job you could do yourself but it will depend on the type and design of sink that you have.
 If the pipework is not easily accessible and it is not an emergency then it is best to call a plumber.
If it is an emergency, you can shut off all water by closing the main internal stop valve under your kitchen sink. How to turn off the water under the sink with no valve Every sink or water appliance in your home should have its own shut-off valve, but if yours don’t, you’re probably left wondering how to turn off the water under the sink with no valve?
If you find that your sink doesn’t have a valve, then the solution is to find the main internal stop tap to stop the flow of water inside your home. As we covered at the beginning this is usually under your kitchen sink, or in the airing cupboard.
Every home also has an external shut-off valve but this is only for use by the emergency services or your water supply company and should not be touched without prior agreement from your water supply company. If your sinks or toilets don’t have their own stop taps then you can have these retrofitted for you by a plumber. How to turn off the water under the sink if the valve is stuck If you’re wondering how to turn off the water to your sink when the valve is stuck then it is always best to seek help from a plumber. You don’t want to force anything or risk damaging your pipework or interrupting our water supply.

Find a plumber your neighbours recommend  FAQs Where is the water shut-off valve under the sink?
The water shut off valve is usually located towards the back in the lower half of the space under your sink.
Which way turns off the water valve?
If you turn the valve clockwise (to the right) then this will close the valve and stop the water supply.

The best bathtubs for small bathrooms,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/best-bathtubs-small-bathrooms/,Bathroom,"The best bathtubs for small bathrooms

In This Blog: Bathtubs for small bathrooms Space-saving bath ideas Baths for small bathrooms Bathtubs for small spaces There’s nothing like a warm bath at the end of a long day. If you have a smaller bathroom you might feel that a bath is out of the question. However, there are more options for a space-saving bath than you might think. Let’s take a look at the best bathtubs for small bathrooms. Bathtubs for small bathrooms Having a smaller bathroom doesn’t mean you have to lose out on a soak in the tub. Most standard bathtubs measure up at 170cm long by 70cm wide and fit ‘wall to wall’ in smaller bathrooms, but more compact baths measuring 150cm by 70cm are available.
Some bathtubs are also available in 180cm lengths so there are a few standard options for wall to wall options. If your bathroom measurements are a little awkward and you can’t get your bathtub to fit wall to wall, you could also consider having a stud wall or partial stud wall built, or have a custom storage area added to fill any oddly sized gap.
If you’re stuck for inspiration, take a look at our  small bathroom ideas on a budget . Space-saving bath ideas When looking at bathtubs for smaller bathrooms, there are three different bathtub styles that can help you save space.
Oval bathtubs
 – If you’re looking for a space-saving bath but want the illusion of a full-size tub, then an oval bath is a great choice. Oval bathtubs are more readily available in smaller sizes but give off a big bath feel.
Slipper bathtubs
 – A slipper bath has a unique shape, with one end of the tub having higher sides and a tall back. These tubs tend to be deeper and have a luxury feel of a roll top style but with a shorter length thanks to the extra depth.
Sunken bathtubs
 – Rather than having your bath stood in the room, you could opt for a bath that is sunken into the floor. This might seem like a wildcard option, but if you are working on a self-build project, or undergoing extensive home renovations where you can spare the extra depth required, this is both a stylish and space-saving bath idea.
Thinking about a new bathroom? Check out our  new bathroom cost guide .

Find a bathroom designer your neighbours recommend  Baths for small bathrooms If you’re after a more traditional style bathtub for small bathrooms, you can still luxuriate in a bath but with a slight twist. A shaped tub keeps the classic bath experience but with clever, space-saving designs.
D shaped bathtubs
 – A D-shaped bath is flat on one side against the wall, with a curved edge extending into the room. This is a good option if you have a small bathroom that is more rectangular in shape.
Tapered bathtubs
 –  A tapered bath has a full-sized width at one end that narrows towards the other. Some have a more gentle curve, whilst others have a sharper, more diagonal angle. These bathtubs are great for small bathrooms as they can help to allow for extra clearance room for moving around toilets or sinks.
All of these choices could be a good option for an en-suite bathroom. If you’re looking for a bath for small en-suite bathrooms then take a look at our  small ensuite ideas . If you’re still stuck then speak to a bathroom design specialist who can help with ideas. Bathtubs for small spaces If your bathroom is a really unique shape, you might want to consider an unconventionally shaped bathtub. Bathtubs for small spaces can come in some interesting shapes including J, P and L shapes. As you might expect, these bathtubs mimic the shape of the letter and can offer an interesting take on a classic bathtub design.
If you have a small or quirky-shaped bathroom, the great news is you don’t have to miss out on a bathtub experience. We have plenty of  small bathroom ideas  to give you inspiration. If you’re ready for your dream bathroom, simply fill in our

Home ventilation solutions,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/home-ventilation-solutions/,Living Room,"Home ventilation solutions

In This Blog: Home ventilation solutions Home ventilation kits Cost of home ventilation systems Ways to reduce indoor air pollution FAQs Hiring a professional Good ventilation in the home is becoming increasingly important, not only for the health of your home but also for the people in it. Pollution and airborne pathogens are ever-present and it’s important there’s adequate ventilation to reduce this.
In this guide, we’ll take a look at a range of home ventilation solutions that can help to reduce air pollution in the home. Home ventilation solutions A well-ventilated living space is a good living space. It’s essential for your building to be well-aired to maintain its value, structural integrity and maintain a healthy environment.
Whether you’re facing problems of condensation, damp, mould or simply want to improve your indoor air quality, there are a number of home ventilation systems to choose from, starting from the most basic vent right up to mechanical ventilation and heat recovery.
Here are some of your options: Extractor fan :
 The most common of ventilation systems and you probably already have one in your bathroom or kitchen. An extractor fan will suck out damp air, creating low pressure that draws in dry, fresh air.
Trickle vents:
 These are the slit-like vents found at the top of double glazed windows. When open they enable ventilation of a room and it’s good to have them open around the house to create an airflow. They do, however, rely on wind and air pressure to work, as they have no electrically-powered fan.
Positive input ventilators (PIV):
 If you have condensation in your home, then the professional installation of this type of ventilation system could be a good solution. Typically, the unit will sit in your loft and draw in fresh air from the outside using a powered fan, this air is then sent via ducting into your rooms, pushing internal stale or damp air out through vents or the gaps in your walls, floors and doors.
Heat exchanger:
 Also known as Mechanical Ventilation and Heat Recovery (MVHR), this system is again typically located in a loft space, pulling warm stale air out of your home and extracting the heat before sending it outside. It then uses this heat to warm up the fresh cold air being pulled in, therefore ‘exchanging the heat’.
The best way to know which ventilation system is right for your home is to speak to an expert. Enter your postcode below to find home ventilation specialists that have been recommended by your neighbours.

Find ventilation experts that are recommended by your neighbours  Home ventilation kits You can buy entire home ventilation kits for your property to either install yourself if you’re competent in this area of specialism, or by a tradesperson. Expert installation is always advisable, as kits are not cheap and they need to be run through the structural fabric of your home.
The benefit of a home ventilation kit is you can get everything you need for property and ventilation requirements in an off-the-shelf system. They can be retrofitted to existing properties of all kinds, or installed during the construction of a new building.
Here are some considerations when researching the right kit for your home:
Make sure you buy a complete kit so all of the parts will match.
Check its suitability for the size of your home and the number of rooms.
Get a full breakdown of parts included for your chosen installer to check.
Be sure to buy from a manufacturer that provides a support line.
Remember to factor in the additional cost of ducting and check size requirements when ordering your kit. Cost of home ventilation systems As you now know, there’s a range of home ventilation systems to choose from depending on the types of indoor air pollution you’re attempting to control. As you’d expect the cost of these systems varies, too. Here’s a rundown of the most common:
Extractor fan installation cost
For installation of a basic  extractor fan , you can expect to pay on average 
£175 for a replacement
 and 
£300 for a new fan
.
Roof vent installation cost
If you’re looking to install  roof vents  to improve airflow in your loft, the cost of 20 circular/eaves vents installed on the front and back of your terraced or semi-detached house will start at around 
£250.
MVHR installation cost
If you need comprehensive air ventilation and removal of indoor pollution, expect to pay on average between 
£2,000 – £4,000
 for domestic  MVHR installation . Your exact price will depend on whether you’re retrofitting and be influenced by the following factors:
The complexities of your property
Your energy needs
Your property size
Pipework access

Find ventilation experts that are recommended by your neighbours  Ways to reduce indoor air pollution As well as all of the ways mentioned above, there are other ways to reduce indoor air pollution. These include stand-alone, plug-in HEPA air filter units, as well as using vacuum cleaners with a HEPA filter installed.
Alternatively, for the most basic of solutions, you can adopt a regime of opening your windows periodically throughout the day, such as every morning when you get up and in the evening when you return from work.
Opening windows on opposite sides of your home (and keeping doors open between them) will ventilate that part of your home. Just be aware that you won’t be able to control the quality of the air you’re letting in. FAQs How can I measure air pollution at home?
You can purchase an indoor air quality monitor to constantly keep an eye on the quality of the air in your home. Each unit will vary in what it detects and displays, such as levels of humidity, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and chemical pollutants.
What are indoor air pollution sources?
Typical indoor air pollutants include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, VOC’s (volatile organic compounds), mould, vehicle fumes and water vapour.
What is the difference between indoor and outdoor air pollution?
Outdoor pollution is any pollutant found in the air outside a property, such as vehicle fumes, industrial pollution and light pollution. Indoor pollution is simply the gathering of various types of pollution inside your property.
This can include pollution coming in from outside, but also internal pollution sources, such as mould, humidity and carbon monoxide.
What are the effects of indoor air pollution on human health?
Effects will vary depending on the type of pollution being experienced. Humidity and mould issues may cause difficulty breathing or chest infections, whereas carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are more serious and can have serious implications. Hiring a professional Reducing pollution in the home is so important for both the health of the people in it and the health and structure of the building. We would always recommend hiring an expert to assess your levels of indoor pollution and professionally install an appropriate ventilation solution.

Clearing the garden in January,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/clearing-garden-january/,Garden,"Clearing the garden in January

In This Blog: What to do in the garden in January Clearing your overgrown garden Organising your garden clear out Get it right for a glorious garden FAQs It may be cold outside in January, but it’s the perfect time to start working on the garden ready for the year ahead. So, channel your new year enthusiasm and energy wisely and use our expert guide to find out the best ways to tackle your garden so that you can maximise your garden’s potential. What to do in the garden in January A garden clear up is the most effective and valuable use of your time as your outdoor space is at its most dormant. Done right, you can encourage the best growth in spring, support wildlife and create a space you want to start enjoying as soon as it starts to warm up. Just make sure before starting anything, you’re aware of any wildlife in your garden and are careful not to destroy their habitat. Hiring a gardener will be best as they will be able to spot the signs of life.
Here are the top jobs to do in January:
Remove those leaves:
 Grab a wheelbarrow or your green bin and sweep, rake and gather all the dropped leaves around your garden. Compost them if you can, and begin to see the lines of your garden once again.
Prune:
 January is a great month to trim any hedges, trees and bushes carefully, deadhead any winter pansies and cut back perennials. Just be careful not to damage new growth.
Clean your equipment:
 The start of the year is an ideal time to clean your garden tools, plant pots, shed and greenhouse. Keeping them in good shape will also keep them lasting for longer.
Pick up your pencil:
 On a nice day, sit outside, grab a warm drink and draw out your garden. Then plan what you want to grow in the months ahead and get your seeds ordered before the spring rush.
Feed the birds:
 They’ll be especially hungry and in need of any nuts, seeds or scraps to get them through the last of the winter. Clearing your overgrown garden January is arguably the best month to clear an overgrown garden. Growth is at its minimum, meaning less work and less rubbish to remove, and also you’ll have a better sight of the job at hand and any plants you want to keep. Here’s our step-by-step guide to clearing your overgrown garden:
Establish what you’re working with:
  Before you chop anything, stand back and look at your garden. Try to discern the shape and outline of your space, and visualise your plan of attack. This will set you up well for every stage of your garden clearance.
Start with any rubbish:
 By this, we mean clearing out any broken pots, furniture, garden features, rusty tools and general litter. This will help you cut vegetation more efficiently and help prevent any injuries.
Cut back to the ground:
 Tackle the central area of your garden first, typically the lawn and flower beds to enable you to gain access to the entire area that needs clearing. Move slow and clear out rubbish as you go.
Know your plants:
 As you clear, you’ll come across different plants, many of which may be ones you’ll want to keep – even if they currently look dead or unattractive. You can use books or apps to identify plants before you give them the chop or, even better,
 hire a  professional gardener  to do that for you, they’ll know what to keep and what to get rid of.
Trim hedges:
 With the plants and grass trimmed back, head onto the hedges and low-hanging trees. It’s always advisable to have them  professionally pruned  by an expert for plant-wellbeing and for a lasting attractive shape when they start to grow back.
Kill the weeds:
 With plenty of light and space available following your hard work, you can now use weedkillers (preferably natural, wildlife-friendly options such as hot water or vinegar) on the plants that you don’t want to keep, including those growing between any paving.
Dig for victory:
 This will help the growth of the flowers, fruit and veg you choose to plant.

Find garden clearance experts recommended by your neighbours  Organising your garden clear out Before picking up your spade or dusting off your rake, it pays to plan your January clear out. Planning how you’ll tackle your garden will help you be efficient and will make sure you create the healthiest living environment for you, your plants and local wildlife.
Have a vision for what you want to achieve and what needs to be done to make it happen. Then, think about whether you can do it yourself, or if it would be better to get a professional in.
Remember, chopping back plants, trees and bushes in the wrong way can result in poor growth or worse still, no future growth at all.
It’s important to consider more than just raking and pruning, too. You might need to remove broken furniture, fix or replace broken fencing and chop down entire trees. There are experts you can hire to take care of each intensive job to a professional standard, from garden clearance specialists and  skip hire providers , to  fence installers  and  tree surgeons . Get it right for a glorious garden The garden clearance work you do in January can make a real difference to your garden’s performance in the year ahead, which is why it pays to get it right.
When to comes to pruning, removing plants and chopping down trees, you really do only have one shot to get it right, as you can cause lasting damage if you cut back too hard or remove established plants that will actually be an attractive part of your garden. This is why it really does pay to get experts in to advise you and carry out the work to a professional standard.

Find garden clearance experts recommended by your neighbours  FAQs What are the right gardening jobs for January?
January is the ideal time to remove fallen leaves and place them in your compost bin. It’s also a good month to prune back hedges, trees and bushes, deadhead any winter pansies and cut back perennials.
As well as cutting back and tidying, your time in January is also well-spent away from your plants. Clean your garden tools, pots, and outbuildings, and draw out the year’s plan for your garden.
And don’t forget the wildlife, leave some winter food out for hungry birds.
What’s the best way to clear an overgrown garden?
Tackle overgrown plants and grass first, clearing space so you can see what you’re dealing with. As you’re clearing, remember to think about which plants you keep, as some could be attractive flowers, even if they look dead.
Then prune back hedges and trees, taking care to do this safely. Finally, use weedkillers to kill off any plants you don’t want and turn over the soil ready for new growth.

How to hang a chandelier,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/hang-chandelier/,Living Room,"How to hang a chandelier

In This Blog: How to hang a chandelier How to hang a heavy chandelier How to hang a chandelier in a tent How to hang a chandelier in a concrete ceiling How to install a chandelier on a sloped ceiling Play it safe with chandeliers FAQs A chandelier can add a touch of class to any room in a home and create a beautiful focal point. But hanging one from a ceiling safely can be a tricky job, with a fair degree of risk involved due to electrical connections and weight considerations.
In this guide, we’ll cover a step-by-step approach to hanging a chandelier so you don’t end up having a Del Boy moment. How to hang a chandelier Before you get started, unpack your chandelier, check it for damage and place it somewhere safe nearby. Then follow these steps:
Prepare your tools, including a sturdy ladder, Phillips and flat head screwdrivers and wire cutters.
Turn off the power. This is absolutely crucial and must be done before attempting to hang your chandelier. Turn off both the room light switch and the power at your fuse box.
Remove the existing light fitting, access the wires and test with a voltage meter to ensure no power is running through.
Fit a brace to the wooden joist in the ceiling where the chandelier will hang. This will provide an anchor point for your chandelier and ensure its weight will be supported. A ceiling hook is also an option.
Attach the chain to the brace or hook that came with the chandelier, test hang with the help of an assistant and cut the chain to the right length.
With the chandelier hanging from the chain, attach the power wire to the terminal box in the ceiling and thread down in and out of the chain. Connect to the chandelier terminal.
Secure all terminal covers with screws, turn the power and the room switch on and your chandelier should be shining bright.
Please note:
 Hanging a chandelier is a potentially dangerous job as you’ll be working at a height with heavy equipment and electricity. For best results and peace of mind that your chandelier won’t be damaged, we recommend hiring an electrician. Simply enter your postcode below or fill in our  request a quote form  to get quotes from three tradespeople near you.

Find a lighting electrician recommended by your neighbours  How to hang a heavy chandelier The key to safely hanging a heavy chandelier is to take your time, be methodical in your work, and use the right tools. You may also need the help of another person to get it in position and possibly a raised platform to support it if it’s particularly heavy.
The most important thing with a heavy chandelier is to make sure it’s properly supported, and that it will be safe to use. You’ll need to find a spot where you can access the wooden joists above the ceiling and you’ll also need to make sure that the chain or wires are strong enough to support it.
Once you’ve confirmed this, the hanging process is the same as with any chandelier. Just be extra careful when lifting and manoeuvring, as you’ll be carrying a lot of weight. How to hang a chandelier in a tent To install a chandelier in a tent, it’s important to get it right the first time as a tent isn’t a strong structure and getting it wrong can be dangerous. Follow these steps to safely hang your chandelier:
First of all, you’ll need the right type of tent. You’ll need a marquee tent with upright steel supports.
Then, create a crossbar between the two side supports or central supports (you can do this using brackets).
Hang your chandelier from the secured crossbar using the steps above and run power to it using mains power or a battery. How to hang a chandelier in a concrete ceiling Hanging a chandelier in a concrete ceiling is very similar to hanging one from wooden joists. As always, the first step is turn off the room light and the mains power at the fuse box, then:
Wearing safety goggles and a mask, drill pilot holes into the ceiling where you want the chandelier to hang.
Insert the anchors that came with the light fitting into the pilot holes and hammer in flush with the ceiling using a rubber mallet.
Attach the mounting bracket to the pilot holes using retaining screws.
Test hang the chandelier to the desired length and cut chain appropriately.
Run power wires, connect and test.
We highly recommend you hire an electrician to do this job. How to install a chandelier on a sloped ceiling Hanging a chandelier on a sloped ceiling can be tricky, but it’s not impossible. You’ll need to get creative with the way you anchor and support the light fixture. One option is to use a beam that spans the length of the ceiling. You can attach the chandelier directly to this beam or use a chain or cable to suspend it. Make sure that the weight of the chandelier is evenly distributed across the beam.
If you don’t have a beam available, you can create one by installing two perpendicular supports into the joists and then attaching a crossbar between them. Play it safe with chandeliers As you now know, when you follow the steps carefully and methodically, it is possible to hang a chandelier safely in your home. That said, there’s a lot that can go wrong when you involve electricity, heavy weight and working at the top of a ladder. 
We always recommend hiring a professional to install your chandelier. 
Simply enter your postcode in the free search tool below to get quotes for your job.

Find a lighting electrician recommended by your neighbours  FAQs How do you hang a heavy chandelier?
Hanging a heavy chandelier requires a strong support securely fastened to a wooden joist or concrete ceiling via a mounting plate. You also need a strong chain and an extra pair of hands to help you lift and hold the chandelier. Consider using a raised platform, too, to support the weight while you fit the chandelier.
Do I need an electrician to hang a chandelier?
No, but as there’s electricity, a heavy weight and working at height involved, using a qualified electrician is always recommended. If you do want to hang your chandelier yourself, you can follow the steps above to do it safely.
Can I hang a heavy chandelier?
Yes, but not alone. A heavy chandelier can be dangerous if not supported correctly during installation and afterwards. Follow the steps above to hang your heavy chandelier safely.
Can you hang a chandelier without a chain?
Yes, you can use rope, cord or anything that’s strong enough to support the weight of your chandelier. Check the maximum weight capacity of the material before buying and make sure it’s greater than the weight of your light fitting.
How low do I hang a chandelier?
This depends on the height of your room and whether anything will be underneath. Typically you want your chandelier no lower than 7 feet from the ground to allow the majority of people to walk under it safely. If you’re wondering how high to hang a chandelier over a dining table, typically a chandelier will sit 30-36 inches above the surface.

How to install a dashcam,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/install-dashcam/,Garage,"How to install a dashcam

In This Blog: How to fit a front dashcam How to fit a rear dashcam FAQs The popularity of dashcams is on the rise in recent years, and it’s not hard to see why. These handy gadgets help drivers protect their vehicles from theft by recording footage and they also provide evidence if an accident were to happen.
Dashcams can be installed in any car, but some are easier than others. In this guide, we explore the different ways of installing a dashcam, including installing a dashcam without a cigarette lighter, installing a dashcam in the front and rear of your vehicle as well as how to wire a dash cam to your fuse box.
How to fit a dashcam
Fitting a dashcam in your car is a relatively straightforward job, however, you’ll need to be careful when removing trim pieces and wiring into the fuse box so you don’t cause any costly damage. Before getting started, have your camera at the ready, as well as your wiring, cable ties, a trim tool, a flat head screwdriver and a Phillips screwdriver. How to fit a front dashcam Locate the car’s fuse box:
 You’ll need to do this first as you’ll be running cables to it from the camera.
Choose your dashcam position:
 Keep it out of your field of view, at the top centre of the windscreen is the best option.
Plan the cable route:
 Use the trim tool to remove trim pieces and place the cable out of sight as you run it from the dashcam to the fusebox. The passenger side is always the preference in order to avoid steering and pedal components.
Connect to the fuse box:
 It’s really important to do this right. First, connect the earth to the chassis, then, choosing a comfort circuit fuse such as a cigarette lighter, insert the spur and connect the power cable to the spur.
Test and tidy. How to fit a rear dashcam Fitting a rear dash cam follows the same process as a front camera, with some slight differences. When running the cable, go under the carpet, not in the roof lining so as to avoid airbags. Try to follow the OEM wiring loom and secure your wire to it with cable ties.
How to mount a rear dashcam
The best location to mount a dashcam is at the centre of the bottom of the windscreen.
While it may sound straightforward to fit a dashcam, an incorrect installation can cause electrical damage or drain your battery. To get quotes for a professional installation of your dashcam, simply enter your postcode below.

Find a local auto electrician recommended by your neighbours  FAQs Is a dashcam easy to install?
It depends on your electrical and technical skills as it involves removing trim pieces and wiring into a fuse box. Care will need to be taken in order to not cause damage to your vehicle. Knowing how to hide dash cam wires is a challenging task, so you’ll need to factor in time to do this properly in order to not have wires on show. If you’re not confident doing this, we recommend hiring a professional.
Is a dashcam the same as a reversing camera?
No. Although they may look similar, a reversing camera’s job is to help with your vision when reversing. It will turn on when you put your car into the reverse gear. Find out more about  reversing cameras  in our cost guide.
How much does it cost to install a dashcam?
Typically, a professional dash cam installation will cost anywhere between 
£30 – £50
. You can find more detailed cost information in our  dashcam installation cost guide .
Do dashcams need to be professionally installed?
You can install a dashcam yourself, as long as you are comfortable removing trim pieces in your car and wiring into your car’s fuse box. It’s important to fuse the power cable correctly to avoid any damage to your vehicle’s electrical system.
For the best results, we recommend getting a dashcam professionally fitted. This will give you complete peace of mind that your dashcam will be fitted properly and you will be able.

How to create a green roof,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/create-green-roof/,Roof,"How to create a green roof

In This Blog: Choose a safe and suitable roof How to make a green roof How to build a green roof on a shed FAQs Green roofs are a great way to utilise what is effectively dead-space in order to create life. A green roof done right has the potential to improve the environment, insulate your home and support biodiversity. Here’s how to make a green roof on your property. Choose a safe and suitable roof Before you purchase any plants, materials or equipment, you need to establish whether you have a safe structure for your green roof. The structural requirements for a green roof include:
Being structurally capable of carrying the significant weight of everything needed to support a healthy green roof. This includes soil, plants and water for irrigation. 
This is unique to every green roof installation and should be assessed by a roofing specialist.
The correct angle of the roof. A maximum of 10 degrees is classed as flat and anything more than this will begin to create a much more challenging, and potentially dangerous, installation. How to make a green roof With your roof confirmed as able to support a green space, you need to purchase all of the materials needed to create a sustainable, low-maintenance green roof. You’ll need waterproofing layers, root barriers, drainage membranes, geotextiles and they all need to be right for your roof before planting:
Waterproofing:
 One of the most important steps in creating a green roof is ensuring that your roof deck is waterproof. This will protect your home from leaks and ensure that the soil and plants on your roof are able to get the water they need. You can use a m
embrane such as PVC, rubber or EPDM to create a watertight seal between the roof deck and the soil. A 
bituminous coating is also an option.
Add a root barrier:
A root barrier is an impermeable membrane that prevents plants from causing root damage to your roof structure. For this, geotextile 
and
HDPE membranes are commonly used.
Drainage layer:
 A drainage layer is essential to collect and channel 
excess
 water away from the roof surface. Aggregate, fibre mats or hydro-retentive materials can all be used, and always ensure you install a filtration layer to prevent soil from getting into drainage channels.
Planting:
Once your green roof is in place you can add soil and fertiliser, water thoroughly and start planting. Choosing the right plants for a green roof is important as they need to be durable and able to thrive in full sunlight with limited access to water.
Please note: Creating a green roof on your home is a potentially dangerous job as you’ll be working at height with heavy materials.
 Added to this, it takes skill and knowledge to get it right. Enter your postcode below to find professional green roof installers that your neighbours recommend.

Find a green roof specialist recommended by your neighbours  How to build a green roof on a shed If you want to start small, and lower to the ground, a green roof can also be installed on a timber structure such as a shed. The process is much the same as when installed on a house, with a few key differences:
The roof of the shed will need to be reinforced to support the weight of the soil and plants.
The timber of the shed will need to be thoroughly waterproofed to prevent rot.
The drainage layer and filter layer are not usually necessary as the volume of water is less and can easily drain off.
A green roof on a shed is a great place to start if you’re considering a DIY approach. Not only is it safer and cheaper, but it also gives you an opportunity to experiment with plants, watering and maintenance ready for any projects that involve your main roof. FAQs Can I make my own green roof?
Yes, you can. But as stated above, there’s a lot to get right if your green roof is to thrive. Plus, if it’s on the roof of your home, there’s also a lot of safety factors to consider. If you feel confident, then the steps above will help you make your own green roof.
How do you make a simple green roof?
There’s not really such a thing as a simple green roof, as their construction requires a number of structural, waterproofing, damage-prevention and planting considerations. If you want your green roof to be an asset and not an expensive eyesore, then you’ll need to design and build your green roof professionally.
How is a green roof constructed?
As stated above, you’ll need a roof structurally capable of supporting a considerable weight. Then you’ll need to waterproof the roof deck, add a root barrier membrane, drainage, filtration, soil and finally plants.
How much does it cost to make a green roof?
The average green roof cost including installation is around 
£7 – £12 per square foot
. You can find out more in our  green roof cost guide .
How do you lay a green roof?
There’s a strict process you need to follow in order to lay a safe and sustainable green roof. This includes a waterproof layer, a root barrier membrane, drainage provision, filtration and finally a growing substrate, such as soil.
Whatever type of green roof you’re planning to create, we always recommend hiring a professional. Enter your postcode below to find your local green roof installer.

Driving away for Christmas: 8 top home security tips,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/christmas-home-security-tips/,Tag Not Found,"Driving away for Christmas: 8 top home security tips

In This Blog: Home security measures over Christmas Locking systems Home CCTV system Burglar alarms Security lighting Ring doorbell Curtains/blinds Lighting on a timer Register your belongings FAQs With Christmas just around the corner, many homeowners will be leaving their homes this festive season. However, as burglaries tend to increase during the month of December, it’s paramount that you consider the security of your home over the Christmas period – especially if you’re planning on staying with family or friends for more than a day or two.
Thankfully, there are several security options on the market that make protecting your home a breeze. With simple solutions such as frosted glass or smart solutions such as WiFi-enabled cameras, making your home impenetrable to anyone but Santa is worth the investment.
As well as making sure presents are hidden, stockings are bare, and St Nicolas knows you’re not there, we’ve pulled together the top 8 steps you can take to secure your home and belongings. Home security measures over Christmas Locking systems The last thing you want to worry about while you sip your mulled wine or eggnog is whether you’ve locked your doors. It’s a common anxiety homeowners face whenever they leave for an extended period of time. So, make sure you can assure those intrusive thoughts there’s nothing to worry about by putting sufficient locks in place – including a deadlock for extra anti-burglar security.
Or you may want to consider a smart lock? The average cost of a smart lock will set you back around 
£202
 for a Yale make. Check out our  smart locks cost guide  for a full breakdown of prices.
Alternatively,  hire a locksmith  to install new locks or upgrade your current ones. Their fees can range from 
£100 – £150
 depending on the make of your lock. Home CCTV system Security systems are the ultimate deterrent to most (smart) thieves, who won’t risk being caught on camera stealing your mince pies, port collection, or other priceless valuables.
Although security systems sound pricey, in today’s tech-savvy marketplace, a basic  4-camera system  could cost you around 
£800
. Burglar alarms If  installing a surveillance system  in your two-bed terrace seems like overkill, then consider buying a burglar alarm instead (or as well!). After all, prevention is better than cure. The noise alone is a deterrent, which usually elicits at least a cursory glance from any neighbours who’ve been disturbed.
A  smart alarm system  will cost you around 
£650
, whereas a wired bell-only alarm will set you back an average of 
£500
.

Hire the local security expert your neighbours trust  Security lighting Anyone who grew up in the ’90s with access to Cartoon Network knows that burglars wear an eye mask, a black and white striped jumper, and carry a bag with the word ‘loot’ written on it. They also know that when burglars are caught red-handed, it’s usually in the spotlight of a torch or security system.
Stereotypes aside, burglars don’t want to be seen. That’s why noise plus lights are enough to deter even the bravest (or stupid) of them. Thankfully,  outdoor security lighting  is relatively cheap, with most systems costing you an average of 
£150
. Ring doorbell A ring doorbell is a great way to see, hear or speak to anyone coming to your door. They often have motion sensors to detect movement, which is why they’re a staple in most homeowners’ properties.
Also, you can pick one up for as little as 
£40
, which is a bargain! Read our  how to install a ring doorbell  guide to learn how to install these handy little security items.

Hire the local security expert your neighbours trust  Curtains/blinds It’s rare that homes leave their windows undressed these days. However, it’s worth mentioning that blinds and curtains are simple and effective security measures that stop prying eyes adding you to their target list. Although keeping curtains closed all day is easy if you’re a vampire, humans tend to struggle with endless darkness. Therefore, installing textured glass or opaque blinds are better options that offer security 
and 
Vitamin D. Privacy glass film  costs an average of 
£475 per m²
, while  integral blinds  will set you back about 
£6,000
 including installation.
If you’re not sure what aesthetic to go for, read our guide:  Curtains vs blinds – All you need to know. Lighting on a timer Most burglars will check out houses before picking which ones to burgle. This means they track when people are in and out of the house and strike when no one is at home. That’s why a good security measure is to install a timer on your lights via a special plug or by overhauling your entire lighting system to a smart one.
A smart bulb can be operated using an app on your phone, through your WiFi, via Bluetooth, or by speaking to Alexa or Siri. This lets you control when you turn on your lights and also helps you randomise the timing so burglars don’t notice your lights turning on and off at the exact same time every day. Smart lighting  for the whole house costs around
 £6,500
 on average. Individual bulbs cost around 
£27
 each. Register your belongings Our last Christmas security top tip is to  register your belongings on immobilise . This makes them immediately available to the police should they be stolen. It also helps simplify insurance claims and increases your chances of recovering your stolen goods.

Hire the local security expert your neighbours trust  FAQs How can I protect my home during Christmas?
If you’re looking to up the Christmas security in your home this year, follow these 8 top tips and grant yourself greater peace of mind over the festive season.
What is the best theft deterrent for a home?
The best deterrents are security systems such as one or a combination of CCTV, burglar alarms, and lighting.
Do Christmas lights deter burglars?
Lights deter burglars because they increase the likelihood that they’re seen or identified. However, Christmas lights also suggest you have presents that might be worth stealing.
Do burglaries increase around Christmas?
Yes, most incidents of burglary increase during the month of December. However, mitigating the risk is as simple as employing one or several of our 8 top tips.

How to maintain a pond,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/maintain-pond/,Garden,"How to maintain a pond

In This Blog: Pond maintenance How to clear green pond water How to keep pond water clear without a filter How to clean pond water with fish in Help your pond thrive FAQs A pond is an attractive feature to have in your garden, but it requires regular care and attention in order to ensure it’s always at its best for your enjoyment, and for any plants and wildlife that live in it. In this guide we’ll go through tips and techniques you can use to keep your pond healthy and happy. Pond maintenance In order to have a clear and healthy pond there are a few things you need to do throughout the year. Here are our top five actions to take to support your pond’s wellbeing:
Filter maintenance: Make sure that it is working properly so that all harmful material is being filtered out of the water. Pond filters should be cleaned at least once a month to ensure they are working correctly and never leave it too long before cleaning out a clogged filter.
Add plants: Plants will help keep your pond healthy by creating an environment that is beneficial for fish and can also help to clear the water. You can fertilise them, too. Just make sure to remove any dead plants and floating leaves.
Cleaning: If your pond contains gravel, this should be cleaned at least once a year in order to remove any built-up waste or muck and keep the pump working properly. Try to use pond water to rinse the gravel, and if not then just fresh water.
Testing: Regularly test for bacteria and ph levels with a kit, a healthy ph level is between 6.5 and 8.5.
Be weather aware: Take steps to protect your pond and its inhabitants from the cold, such as adding a layer of insulation or using a heater.
Note that if you have fish in your pond, you may find you need to clean your pond water more often. It’s advisable to check the water on a weekly basis and take out any leftover food or waste promptly.
It’s really important to get pond maintenance right, so as not to cause any damage to the life in your pond. Enter your postcode below to find local pond care professionals that your neighbours recommend.

Find pond maintenance specialists recommended by your neighbours  How to clear green pond water It’s normal for ponds to get a bit cloudy every now and then, but if your pond water gets too murky or starts to smell, here’s how to get rid of algae in your pond.
There are a few easy steps you can take to clear green pond water:
Try adding a bit of barley straw. It releases certain enzymes that collect free-floating algae and clump them together, causing them to sink. The downside is that it can take a few weeks for the barley straw to work, so you may need to be patient.
If you don’t want to wait and you want to know how to clear green pond water fast, you can try using an algaecide. Be careful when using algaecides, as they can be harmful to fish and other pond life. Choose carefully and only use them if absolutely necessary.
You can also try stirring up the water to make it less cloudy. This will help light to reach the bottom of the pond.
Finally, you can add some plants to your pond. Plants are a very natural way of clearing green water, as they use photosynthesis to convert the energy from sunlight into oxygen that aerates your pond water. Pond weeds are particularly good for clearing green pond water. How to keep pond water clear without a filter If you’re wondering how to get rid of green algae in a pond naturally, these are some of the ways you can keep it looking crystal clear without a filter:
Remove any fallen leaves in your pond. Leaves break down and fertilise the water, causing algae growth, plus they’ll prevent natural light from breaking up murky surface scum.
Add some plants. Pond plants help remove algae and excess nutrients from the water by taking them up through their roots. They are also a great option if you have fish in your pond, as they are completely natural, can be a food source and will provide shelter.
Add some barley straw to your pond, it collects algae and effectively transfers it the from the surface to the bottom of your pond.
Consider using an algaecide to break down the algae, but choose carefully and if you have fish or other aquatic life in the pond, always ensure the algaecide you use is safe for wildlife. How to clean pond water with fish in Fish are an integral part of a water ecosystem and will play an important role in keeping your pond clean. There are a number of ways you can clean your pond without harming fish and other wildlife, including frogs, toads, snails and newts. These include:
Introducing a pump and filter to remove debris, create aeration and keep the water fresh.
Adding a pond vacuum to suck up debris and clean the fish pond bottom.
Introducing pond plants help clean a pond naturally by absorbing nutrients from the water.
Use algaecide that’s safe for fish, but make sure you’re choosing and using the right one in order to avoid potentially irreversible damage to the health of your fish.
Whatever you choose to do, it’s really important to make sure that the fish are safe and not stressed while cleaning occurs, and it’s always advisable to consult a fishpond maintenance professional. Help your pond thrive When a pond is professionally maintained throughout the year, it is a joy to behold for its owner and becomes a thriving ecosystem for the plant and animal life that inhabits it.
When considering your maintenance options, your really need to understand the unique environment of your specific pond and choose techniques and solutions to match.
Hiring a local pond care professional is your best bet to having a well maintained and thriving pond.

Decking vs patio cost – pros and cons When trying to decide between decking or a patio, the initial cost will be a huge factor in your decision, but you also need to consider other costs that you might need to pay. Let’s look at the pros and cons…
Decking pros and cons
Pros
Typically, it’s quicker and simpler to install than a patio
The overall cost is usually cheaper than a patio
Cons
Timber decking requires a lot of ongoing maintenance and aftercare
Poorly maintained decking will crack, warp and become unusable, so there will be ongoing costs for maintenance and repair.
Patio pros and cons
Pros
Flagstones are very durable
Concrete is durable and cost-effective
In general, patio’s are very low maintenance
Cons
Flagstones are heavy and take longer to install which may add to the cost
Concrete is expensive to repair if it cracks
Raised patios can be more complex to build, take more time and therefore, more expensive

Find landscapers your neighbours recommend  Patio cost vs deck hourly rates As we’ve covered the overall costs will vary but as a general guide, a landscape gardener will cost between 
£12.50 and £18.75 per hour
, or approximately £100-£150 per day.
A bricklayer will charge between 
£18.75 to £31.25 per hour
 or £150 to £250 per day. Patios usually take 3-4 days to lay.
Labour charges for decking are similar but depending on the size and style of your decking, you can expect the job to take 1-2 days. Decking vs patio cost calculator You’ll understand by now that the cost will ultimately depend on the size and materials you choose, but to help you with a comparison of the cost of a patio vs a deck we’ll look at average costs.
For an average-sized patio of 25 square metres with an average cost per metre of 
£102.50
 you can expect to pay 
£2,560
. You will need to potentially factor in an additional £40 per square metre if any groundwork or preparation needs to be done before the patio can be laid.
You may also require a skip to dispose of any waste materials from the groundwork which can cost on average 
£215 per week
.
For decking, you can expect to pay 
£1,200 to £2,000
 for the main decking material, plus labour of approximately 
£200 per person, per day
. Additional costs you may need to consider are weed membrane material at 
£15 for 20 metres
 and 
decking treatment
 at approximately 
£30
. If you require rails, balustrades and spindles these will also come at an additional cost.
As you can see the cost can really vary, so for an accurate cost guide, it is best to speak to a professional and get a quote.

How to spray paint kitchen cabinets,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/spray-paint-kitchen-cabinets/,Kitchen,"How to spray paint kitchen cabinets

In This Blog: Tools and materials you’ll need How to spray paint kitchen cabinets FAQs Learning how to spray paint kitchen cabinets is a fun, cost-effective, and environmentally-friendly way to update the heart of your home.
Modernising or putting a new twist on your existing cupboards and drawers is a great way to reuse what you already have rather than sending it to landfill.
And, with the average 
new kitchen in the UK costing 
£9,500
, there’s also a strong financial argument for updating what you have rather than buying new. Tools and materials you’ll need In order to get a professional-looking finish, you will need to make sure you have the right tools and products for the job. These include:
Screwdriver
Sugar soap solution
Some clean lint-free cloths
Sandpaper and filler
Putty knife
Painter’s tape and protective sheeting
Primer and brush
HVLP (high volume, low pressure) paint sprayer
High-quality latex paint
Respirator mask, gloves, overalls, safety goggles How to spray paint kitchen cabinets If you’re confident in your painting skills, there’s no reason why you can’t spray paint your kitchen cabinets yourself.
However, if you’re at all concerned about the finish you might be able to achieve, drip marks, or whether you have the time to complete this job to a high standard, we recommend  hiring a professional . Hiring a professional will ensure perfect results.
If you’d like to give it a go, follow our step by step instructions. If you’re interested in wrapping, take a look at our  kitchen door wrapping cost guide .
How to paint kitchen cabinets with a spray gun
Step 1: Dismantle
Remove the cabinet doors and set them down in your work area (make sure this is somewhere you don’t mind getting messy).
Top tip: Label the doors (in the hinge hole) so you know which cabinet they belong to.
Step 2: Clean
Clean the cabinet doors, and the cabinets (attached to the wall), with sugar soap and a lint-free cloth to remove any grease or dirt. This is a really important step to make sure you get a good finish.
Step 3: Prep
Use masking tape and protective sheeting to shield any areas that are not to be painted. For example, the inside of the cabinets, walls, floor, ceiling, worktops, cooker hood, and appliances.
Top tip: Using a brush to apply the primer and paint to the cabinet frames, sides and trim will avoid the need for protective sheeting, therefore saving you time.
Step 4: Fill and sand
At this stage, you can repair any holes or dents with an appropriate filler and putty knife (depending on your cabinet material, for example, wood or veneer).
Once dry, sand all the areas you wish to paint. You’re aiming to scuff the surface up a little and take off the shine. Clean away the dust with a damp cloth.
Step 5: Prime
Once dry, you’re ready to apply a light coat of stain-blocking primer to the cabinets and door fronts, either using a brush or a spray gun. We recommend using a brush for the primer. Leave to dry for the recommended time.
Sand, wipe the surface clean and then apply a second coat of primer.
Step 6: Spray paint
When the primer is dry, prepare and fill the paint sprayer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Some paints need to be thinned before use in a paint sprayer. Check your product for details.
Top tip: Practice your technique first on a piece of cardboard.
Wearing a respirator mask, spray the door edges first.
Next, spray any detail on the doors, e.g. trim or molding.
Then, keeping the nozzle of the spray gun 10-12 inches from the surface of the cabinet door, sweep your whole arm (not just your wrist) back and forth to apply a light coat of paint to the entire door.
Any drips can be touched up gently with a paintbrush while the paint is still wet.
Allow to dry overnight before giving the doors a second coat.
The whole process will need to be repeated on the other side of the door once the first side is dry.
Top tip: If you’re painting the kitchen cabinets outside, check the weather, both for rainfall and temperature. If it’s too cold, your paint may not dry. If painting indoors, build a makeshift painting booth to contain the airborne spray and make sure you ventilate the room.
Step 7: Reassemble
Leave the cabinets and door fronts to dry for at least 24 hours before fixing the hardware back onto the doors and mounting the doors back onto the cabinets.
This guide is intended to help you achieve a professional spray paint finish on your kitchen cabinets. However, you can use the same process to update your kitchen drawers, end panels, and plinths to complete the look.
If you’re not sure about using these tools and techniques yourself, contact a local specialist who’ll be happy to provide a quote for the job. Our post on the  cost of spray painting kitchen cabinets  will give you an idea of what to expect.

The cost to repair the Byer’s house in Stranger Things,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/repair-byers-house-stranger-things/,Living Room,"The cost to repair the Byer’s house in Stranger Things

In This Blog: Extensive damage repairs Remove wallpaper and redecorate Modernise each room Install new flooring SPOILER ALERT
 – If you haven’t watched 
Stranger Things Season 3
 just yet, proceed with caution…
Final warning…
At the end of Stranger Things Season 3, Joyce, Jonathan, Will, and Eleven moved out of their house and away from their home in Hawkins, leaving the property on the market as a prime piece of real estate.
That got us thinking. If you decided to buy their house (a do-er up-er for sure), how much would it cost you to give it a makeover? According to  House Beautiful  in 2017, the cost to buy the Byer’s property would set you back a cool £76,000. However, once it’s been repaired, restored, and modernised, the potential profits increase tenfold.
Regardless of whether you’d choose to live in your new Hawkins home or let it out to a Demogorgan, it’s a property that certainly needs some work! So, let’s take a look at a few of the main fixes and how much they’ll cost to complete.
For a similar cost breakdown, read our comprehensive  house repair cost guide .

Hire builders your new neighbours recommend  Extensive damage repairs Repair holes
The property suffers from numerous dents and scratches across the walls and ceilings. This is primarily due to the number of festoon lights nailed throughout the home. To quickly fix these holes, we recommend  hiring a handyman  at an average rate of 
£25 per hour
.
Alternatively, the  cost to repair a hole in drywall  averages 
£120
 for a foot-sized dent.
Upcycle or restore furniture
During a battle for dominance against the Demogorgon, the Byer’s executed their right to defend their property, which resulted in substantial damage to their furniture. The best fix is to  repair or restore these items  at an average of
 £150 per item
.
Fill in the gunshot holes and axe marks
For larger holes and areas of the house that have been hit with an axe, we recommend undertaking extensive replastering and restructuring works. On average, the  cost to replaster  a small room is 
£650
. For cracked  foundation repairs , you’re looking at around 
£1,250
.
Repair any temporary portals
Before you settle into your new home, it’s worth noting that portals are a common occurrence in the town of Hawkins. One even popped up in the Byer’s home during Will’s disappearance in Season 1 of Stranger Things, which needed explosives to remove. This tends to leave a mess, which requires extensive cleaning to clean away.
To make sure all traces of the portal disappears, give the area a good scrub. Alternatively,  hire a professional cleaner  at around 
£16 per hour
 to do it for you.

Hire builders your new neighbours recommend  Remove wallpaper and redecorate Due to the alphabet graffiti drawn all over the walls in thick marker pen, the Byer’s house definitely needs new wallpaper. The ink stains have probably seeped into the walls too, so be prepared to replaster if necessary.
The average cost to  remove wallpaper  is 
£350
 per room. Alternatively, the average  cost to paint a room  is 
£400
.
Hire an interior designer
If you’re looking for a change but don’t know how to turn the Byer’s home into a contemporary dreamscape, why not hire an  interior designer  to help you? Prices range from 
£50 – £150 per hour
.

Hire builders your new neighbours recommend  Modernise each room The 1980s aren’t known for their timeless decorative style. In fact, most ’80s houses look dated and drab, which is why it’s worth upgrading each room for a modern twist or contemporary overhaul.
New living room, kitchen, and bathroom
The Byer’s bathroom is dim, cluttered, and lacking in character. Thankfully, a  new bathroom  costs between 
£1,500 – £7,500 
depending on your desired aesthetic.
The Byer’s house boasts a split kitchen and lounge. The kitchen is separated by an island that can easily be removed to make more space. Depending on your preferences, the price of your new kitchen could vary from 
£1,000
 (a budget kitchen renovation that excludes new worktops or appliances) to 
£20,000+
 (for a high-spec/luxury kitchen that’s professionally designed and installed).
Redecorate bedrooms
In Stranger Things, the Byer’s bedrooms are plain and lacking in style. Although they’re the rooms that require the least amount of work, it’s worth taking them into consideration and upgrading them in line with the rest of the property.
The average cost of  hiring a painter and decorator  is 
£190 per day
, while the  average cost of a fitted bedroom  is 
£3,200
.

Hire builders your new neighbours recommend  Install new flooring With old and battle-damaged floors and carpets covering most of the Byer’s house, it’s worth ripping them up and installing some hardier and easier-to-clean options. Expect the following costs: Wood flooring  costs between 
£1,000 – £1,500
. Amtico flooring  costs anywhere from 
£20 to £90 per square metre
. Parquet flooring  costs an average of around 
£50 per m2, 
whereas labour costs between 
£100 – £200 per day
.
Hiring a floor layer to install  herringbone flooring  will average between 
£180 – £300 per day
.
A  carpet fitter  will charge between 
£120 – £150 per day
. However, this doesn’t include the cost of the carpet itself.
Despite the extensive works required to restore this suburban 3-bedroom property, along with the likelihood of an upside-down guest at some point, the result of this restoration will let you flip it for a profit. At the very least, you can prepare for battle in a stylish kitchen retrofitted with vintage features and easy-wipe accessories.

What to do if your house floods,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/flooded-house-clean-up/,Tag Not Found,"What to do if your house floods

In This Blog: What to do if your house floods? What to do if your house floods – first steps What to do if your house floods – returning home What to do if your house flooded and you have no flood insurance Flooded house clean up – repairing a flood damaged house Flood damage repair Would you know what to do after a flood in your house? It’s not a situation anyone wants to imagine, so we’ve created this guide to help with repairing a flood damaged house. What to do if your house floods? It goes without saying that the most important thing is your safety. Flood water can be dangerous, so if you are in your home when the flooding happens you must leave and get to safety immediately. What to do if your house floods – first steps The action you take immediately after a house flood is really important and can affect the cost and speed of the flood damage repair. The first things you should do are:
Call your home insurance company to let them know what has happened.
Find alternative accommodation – Contact family and friends, find a hotel or B&B, or speak to your local authority if you have a priority housing need.
Contact family, close friends, and your employer to let them know the situation.
Depending on our home insurance policy you may have a provision for emergency funds and accommodation, so it is important to contact your insurance provider immediately to find out what your premium covers you for. What to do if your house floods – returning home If you have appropriate insurance cover, your insurance provider should help you with the repair effort by providing a loss adjuster to assess the extent of the damage. This could take between 24hrs and three days for this to be arranged.
You must not return home until it is safe to do so.
Don’t walk through any floodwater, wear protective clothing and don’t go alone.
Don’t turn on mains services – there may need to be an inspection.
Check your property for structural damage
Depending on the extent of the flooding, your insurer may need to help you appoint an RICS surveyor to assess any structural damage. It is important that any structural issues are fixed before the clean-up operation can begin. When repairing a flood-damaged house it’s important to repair things in the right order to prevent long term structural issues and damp. What to do if your house flooded and you have no flood insurance If you have no flood insurance then it will be up to you to cover the costs of the flood damage repair and organising the clean up. You should:
Keep records of all damage to the property and your possessions.
Contact your borough, district or local council as they may be able to offer support.
Check for local charities or voluntary groups, especially if you are not the only one affected by flood damage.

Find an emergency cleaner your neighbours recommend  Flooded house clean up – repairing a flood damaged house If you are working with a loss adjuster, keep in close contact with them so that your flooded house clean up can begin as quickly as possible. Drying your house after a flood is one of the most important jobs.
Drying a house after a flood can take weeks or months and it must be done thoroughly to avoid damp and associated health problems. For more information on water removal, read our  water removal cost guide .
Once silt and debris have been removed, the drying out can begin. Bricks and concrete take up water slowly but take a long time to dry out if left in standing water. It takes approximately one month of drying out time per inch of standing water.
To help with the drying out generators, pumps and driers will be required. Your insurance company may help to arrange the hire of these but if your insurance does not cover this you will need to source these. A flooded house clean up is a huge job, so it may be worth investigating the help of expert emergency flood cleaners.
If the flood damage is severe, you may also need to contact  clearance specialists  or  hire a skip . If you are working with your insurance company, don’t get rid of anything until the loss adjuster has been and keep photographic evidence and notes on anything that has been damaged. Flood damage repair Once your property is dry, the flood damage repair can begin. If you have insurance, a loss adjuster will usually select the appropriate tradespeople to help. If you want to select your own you can, but you will need to ensure they are competent. Some of our trade member’s work comes with a guarantee, so when you search our site,  look for the guarantee badge .
You will probably require the services of a plumber, electrician and a builder to help reinstate working electrics and plumbing or repair any structural damage. Again if working with a loss adjuster, they may suggest, or even require that you make changes to  prevent future flood damage  such as replacing carpet for  water resistant flooring , or  raising electrical sockets .
You may also require  kitchen  or  bathroom  fitters to replace damaged cabinets or appliances. Once these bigger jobs have been completed, then comes re-decoration where you may need the help of  plasterers  and  painters and decorators .
Nobody wants to be in the position of drying a house after a flood or repairing a flood damaged house, so for preventative tips, take a look at our  flood prevention cost guide .

Checkatrade member Ismail
Demiryogan 
at
 Gem Plastering, Kent,
 recently undertook a job where here he had to re-render an entire property after the customer had shoddy work done by a rogue trade. Ismail said that the rendering was horrendous and inconsistent and when he put a level against it, he could see it swooping out and away from the house.
The customer had paid £3,000 for the job and had to pay Ismail another £2,000 to correct the work. They had their previous plastering hacked off and stripped and replaced, but when it was done again, it was worse than the plastering they had before.
When the customer complained, the rogue trade simply stopped answering their calls, leaving them with no option but to get another plasterer in to fix it.
It took Ismail four all-day visits to the property to complete the job and he had to strip much of the plastering and begin rendering from the brickwork from scratch.
The customer was delighted to finally have the plastering they wanted, but it cost them twice as much money for the job.
Ismail says that the shortage of professional, skilled trades means that since everyone is booked to capacity, it is giving cowboys the opportunity to capitalise on the gap in demand and people are so desperate for work to be done, they are not being as careful with parting with their money.
To avoid falling prey to rogue trades, Ismail says that it is important to check for valid reviews or their previous work.
He says: “
You can’t always be sure when it comes to price because everyone charges differently and remember, you pay for experience too. It’s the same with the length of time you take – I’m faster than other people I know when using certain tools, but they can still do a great job, so it’s not always as simple as that. The only way you can be sure you’re getting the job done properly is to check their previous customer satisfaction and work – this way, you can properly gauge their professionalism and the quality of their work.”

Checkatrade member Mateusz Jurezak 
at
 Property Connection, Manchester
 specialises in construction and installations and notes that an increasing number of jobs are now fixing work done by previous rogue trades. He said that around 15 per cent of the jobs he undertakes now involve correcting poorly done or incomplete work where customers have been left out of pocket and having to look elsewhere.
One recent example was a job with a customer who had work done on their bathroom where the previous trade installed stone tiles poorly. The tiles were not properly cut, crooked, and they hadn’t properly primed the space before laying them.
Because of the poor installation the tiles had begun to fall off with cracks appearing in the mortar. The shoddy tiling caused the shower to leak with cracks also appearing in the wall tiles.
To fix the work, Mateusz had to strip back the poor workmanship and start from scratch to prevent the shower from leaking further and causing more damage to the customer’s property. He changed the entire arrangement of the shower tiles, installed moisture-resistant plasterboard and put in rustproof bolts.
The rogue trade that had done the job charged the customer £4,000 for the work and they then had to foot a second bill of £2,000 for Mateusz to fix it just a year later.
When it comes to actions homeowners can take to avoid becoming victim to rogue trades, Mateusz believes that it is important not to be lured in by seemingly cheaper prices as it will typically cost more in the long run.
He says: “
A good way of dodging these types of situations is to look at the quote the trade gives you. Quotes should include a breakdown of every single job and expense. Look for the quality of the quote and if someone has taken the time to prepare it properly
 – it’s a sign the
company is trying to give you the best service. 
Be careful if you see a price that looks too good to be true, as it usually is and more hidden costs will spring up at a later date. Often people offer cut-price quotes for jobs that they simply cannot complete within budget, this should always be a warning sign. Choosing the cheapest price often means you will have to pay again for the same job – go for trades with good reviews, not just those with the cheapest price.”

Neelm Babbar, 55 from North Harrow fell victim to a rogue trade whom she found on Facebook. Following an initial positive meeting where the trade quoted for the job, Neelm was confident he would do a great job in repainting her family home.
That evening however, the trade pressurised Neelm for the deposit payment claiming if it wasn’t paid that night, he couldn’t do the job as he had another opportunity. With a lack of available tradespeople and the job needing doing ahead of their daughter’s wedding, Neelm paid the trade at 10pm that night to secure the job.
The trouble then continued where on the first day, the trade spent most of their time on the phone, barely did any work and then claimed they had to leave as they didn’t feel well. The trade then failed to show the next day and on the third day he came late claiming he had been ill. After several days, Neelm’s daughter confronted the trade and called out his lack of work as the job had been quoted for 4-5 days and needed completion upon a certain deadline. The trade then claimed he wasn’t happy having his work questioned and left, never to return.
The trade refused to answer Neelm and her family’s messages and when they did manage to get through, he threatened them and told them never to contact him again.
The trade quoted £1,350 for the whole job and they paid up front as requested so were left frustrated, out of pocket and back to square one with their renovation.
Neelm said, “
The whole experience was awful and left us completely out of pocket let alone without a finished job. To get the job complete, we had to start from scratch with the support of a reputable tradesperson.”

Rogue plasterer leaves Leicester man in home renovation limbo for a year,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cowboys/rogue-plasterer-leaves-leicester-man-in-home-renovation-limbo-for-a-year/,Tag Not Found,"Rogue plasterer leaves Leicester man in home renovation limbo for a year

Dave Paget, 44, from Leicester decided to undertake an extensive refurb including new carpets and renovating walls. With lots of people taking on renovation projects during the pandemic, Dave struggled to find a reputable plasterer. However, a friend recommended a tradesperson who had availability, so Dave took him on trusting a known recommendation.
When briefing the trade for the job, Dave was talked out of new plasterboards and told he didn’t need them – which he now thinks was because they didn’t know how to replace them let alone hold basic plastering skills.
From day one, Dave said it was a disaster with the trade turning up late, leaving early and seemingly lacked the ability for what should have been a straightforward plastering job.
The trade also sent Dave out to buy basic plastering tools and materials and claimed bonding agent wasn’t needed before then backtracking. He even cut up one of Dave’s bath towels and made eye holes from it to use as a mask and wanted to come and plaster overnight as he admitted it was his side hustle job.
After nine visits, Dave was tired of the shambles and looked elsewhere for a professional. “
My daughter’s bedroom ceiling resembled a dirt bike track and, in some sections, it had no plaster at all as the tradesperson claimed it didn’t need it. The walls were left bowed in some sections with dips in others. Whilst, for the corners of the room, the trade even used a silicone filler typically used in bathrooms as he had no idea how to properly tackle the corners and this obviously came off at the slightest touch.
”
Dave and his family were left for nearly a year with half done walls, unable to find anyone available to rectify the job due to the pandemic and couldn’t lay their new carpets as part of their wider home renovation.
In the end, Dave had paid the tradesperson £300 for the job which when added to the cost of a professional to rectify and finish it, cost him £1,800 in the end.
Dave continued; “
A plasterer came to look at the work and laughed before popping a bubble on the ceiling where the plaster had blistered. It was one of the worst jobs he had seen – from using the wrong mix and likely gone off plaster to leaving a finish which cost significantly more to rectify
.’’

Nothing bespoke about the rogue builder that left Manchester teacher out of pocket,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cowboys/nothing-bespoke-about-the-rogu/,Tag Not Found,"Nothing bespoke about the rogue builder that left Manchester teacher out of pocket

Dan Brown, 40 from Manchester wanted a tradesperson to build bespoke fitted wardrobes for his 8-year-old daughter’s bedroom. He turned to Facebook on the assumption that local recommendations would see him work with a reputable builder.
As a result, Dan found someone who appeared to have lots of positive reviews across a range of jobs from bespoke furniture to building work and quoted Daniel £1,700 for work and materials.
Dan hired him and as requested, paid £800 up front for the price of materials however only days later, he was then asked for another £300 for materials and was told that materials had ‘shot up in price’. Whilst Dan questioned this, he said he took the man on face value and trusted him and agreed a further £150 up front giving him the benefit of the doubt.
The job started and Dan returned from work only to find cheap plywood materials for the framework and doors had been purchased – not those agreed or paid for. More worryingly, the bedroom wall was full of holes where the builder claimed he was trying to find the hard part of the walls to secure the structure onto.
Dan knew this wasn’t right despite the builder insisting the structural damage was ok and that it didn’t matter as the wardrobe would hide it.
Following the incorrect materials, promises the wall being fixed and being led in circles, the builder stopped taking Dan’s calls. The trade then refused to come back to complete the work and accused Dan of changing the parameters of the job leaving Dan significantly out of pocket.
Dan’s daughter is now the proud owner of built-in wardrobes thanks to Checkatrade where he was able to find a father and son duo who after hearing his story, did the work at cost price. He has since recommended them to his parents, brother and friends for their own bespoke builds.
Dan said, “
Going with a Facebook recommended tradesperson I thought I would be in good hands however I realised there is no proof of credibility on there – it could be their friends or family writing it and duping honest paying customers. The opportunity for credible and verified reviews with a guarantee would have saved time and money and is something definitely needed. I was lucky in that I found great tradespeople to finish the job without being too out of pocket in the end however not everyone is so lucky”.

6.7 million people have been impacted by a rogue trade in the last year,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cowboys/6-7-million-people-have-been-affected-by-a-rogue-trade-in-the-last-year/,Tag Not Found,"6.7 million people have been impacted by a rogue trade in the last year

We’ve carried out new research which has revealed a staggering 6.7 million UK adults* have been impacted by a rogue trade over the last year.
Increasing demand for tradespeople, Brexit and the ongoing raw materials shortage have placed a huge amount of pressure on the home improvement industry, creating the ideal environment for rogue trades to step in and take advantage.
This perfect storm has caused 1 in 3 UK adults to put off home improvement work for fear of hiring a rogue trade.
Mike Fairman, CEO, Checkatrade said
, “
Checkatrade is renowned for stamping out rogue trades.
For 22 years we’ve made it our mission to eliminate the cowboys – we won’t stand for poor workmanship, overcharging or pressuring homeowners in undertaking unnecessary work. In fact, i
n the last three years alone we have removed almost 5,000 tradespeople from our platform who failed to keep up our high standards.
“We’re proud to help homeowners connect with reputable, checked trades – but if you’re one of the 1 in 5 people who would consider using an unverified trade, beware that it’s not as easy as you might think to spot the cowboys from the good guys.” 
Rogue trade watch outs
Electrical (21%), roofing (21%), building (20%) and plumbing (20%) have been found to be the most common home improvement work affected by rogue trades. With 55% of people not confident they can spot a cowboy from a verified trade, Checkatrade share their key watch outs for homeowners:
Be wary of high availability
: Some unverified trades will take advantage of busy periods or moments of crisis such as extreme weather. Read reviews, and ensure trades are vetted and qualified to undertake the requested work.
Be careful of cheap quotes: 
If the cost seems too good to be true, it most likely is. The cheapest quote is normally only cheaper because it’s been  rushed or corners have been cut . Remember, cheap work can’t always be rectified.
Beware of being asked for full payment upfront:
 Don’t agree to making full payment in advance of work being undertaken.  Get a detailed written quote  that includes T&Cs and states what will be covered by the quote – and what won’t.
NEVER accept work from trades who ‘doorstep’
: 44% of people have been doorstepped – but reputable trades will NEVER carry out this practice. Checkatrade has zero tolerance of any member found to be canvassing door-to-door. Never be pressured in to having work done by someone who knocks on your door.
Checkatrade’s guarantee
As well as ‘Eliminating Rogue Trades’, Checkatrade has also  launched a new guarantee . This offers homeowners who book a job via Checkatrade up to £1,000 if their job doesn’t go to plan.

Could you spot a rogue trade?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cowboys/could-you-spot-a-rogue-trade/,Tag Not Found,"Could you spot a rogue trade?

Are you one of the 1 in 5 people who would consider chancing it with an unverified trade? Beware! It’s not as easy as you might think to spot the cowboys from the good guys.
Perhaps surprisingly 45% of people think they could spot a cowboy from a verified trade, but with 6.7 million of us caught out by a cowboy in the last year – it might not be as easy as you think. Rogue trades are everywhere, but electrical (21%), roofing (21%), building (20%) and plumbing (20%) have been found to be the most common home improvement work affected by cowboy trades.
Here are our top four tips for keeping the cowboys at bay:
Be wary of high availability: Some unverified trades will take advantage of busy periods or moments of crisis such as extreme weather. Read reviews, and ensure trades are vetted and qualified to undertake the requested work.
Be careful of cheap quotes: If the cost seems too good to be true, it most likely is. The cheapest quote is normally only cheaper because it’s been rushed or corners have been cut. Remember, cheap work can’t always be rectified.
Beware of being asked for full payment upfront: Don’t agree to making full payment in advance of work being undertaken. Get a detailed written quote that includes T&Cs and states what will be covered by the quote – and what won’t.
NEVER accept work from trades who ‘doorstep’: 44% of people have been doorstepped – but reputable trades will NEVER carry out this practice. Checkatrade has zero tolerance of any member found to be canvassing door-to-door. Never be pressured in to having work done by someone who knocks on your door.

Landlord electrical responsibilities,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/landlord-electrical-responsibilities/,"Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Landlord electrical responsibilities

In This Blog: What are landlord electrical safety certificates? New landlord electrical regulations Electrical checks and testing for landlords Need an electrical safety check? How much does an electrical safety check cost? Which tradespeople should you use for the job? As a landlord, you have a responsibility to keep tenants safe inside your properties from electrical injuries. So, what exactly are your landlord electrical responsibilities?
Well, you need to arrange for an  electrical safety check  to be carried out every 5 years. You also need to ensure this is done by a properly qualified electrician. Remember, you’re responsible for protecting your tenants from burns, shocks, fires, and explosions.
If any issues are found during the check, you’ll be responsible for repairs. This may include repairing wiring, damaged sockets and faulty fuse boxes. What are landlord electrical safety certificates? Once a safety check has been carried out by a competent electrician, you’ll be issued an electrical safety certificate. This document is evidence that the property you rent out is safe for your tenants. It covers essential electrical checks, such as wiring, sockets and lighting. The certificate also lists any improvements you need to make.
Legally, this certificate needs to cover any electrical risks, whether the capacity of the electric circuits is strong enough, if there’s a poor standard of electrical work, and whether the electrics are correctly earthed.
Make sure you have an up-to-date certificate, that you provide a copy to new or existing tenants, and that you’re prepared to show this to local authorities if they request it.

Find an electrical safety check expert  New landlord electrical regulations In 2020 a range of new electrical regulations for landlords came into play that legally you need to follow.
As well as getting safety checks every five years, these regulations state that you need to ensure you meet the standards in the 18
th
 edition of the Wiring Regulations. What’s more, any risks or concerns highlighted by your safety check need to be addressed within 28 days.
When it comes to appliances, the law is a little ambiguous. It’s not a legal requirement that you get any appliances in your property checked, however, you’re still responsible for these appliances and need to ensure they’re safe to use.
For further guidance on the new landlord electrical regulations, please visit the  Gov.uk page  where these are explained in more detail. Electrical checks and testing for landlords While you’re only required to get an electrical safety check every five years, there are a number of electrical checks and testing that landlords can carry out during inspections. You don’t need to be an electrician to perform these checks and you may help prevent an accident.
Consider checking the following as part of your property inspections:
Whether power sockets are working
Whether any lights are flickering
Whether there are any stains or brown marks next to power sockets
Whether any electrical items are crackling
Whether any fuses have been tripped
Whether any power sockets give out sparks when used
Whether any appliances have stopped working
Whether there are any exposed wires
Whether any switches aren’t working Need an electrical safety check? As a responsible landlord, you’ll want to have your properties checked every five years by a competent and qualified electrician. But  how can you find an electrician you can trust ?
Well, our members are thoroughly checked to ensure you get the best service possible. With recommendations from your neighbours, you can be sure you’re hiring the right worker for your job.
We’re so confident in our members’ abilities that we’re now offering a  guarantee  that provides up to £1,000 of cover to put things right in the unlikely event something goes wrong. What’s more, this guarantee is completely free, as long as you use an eligible trade. To find a range of local electricians, just use our  free search feature  to save yourself time and energy.
Looking for more tips and guidance when choosing an expert for your job? The  HomeOwners Alliance  website is packed with information plus DIY guides for home projects. How much does an electrical safety check cost? Once you’re ready to go ahead with your electrical safety check, it may be handy to know how much you need to budget for this. Our  electrical safety check cost guide  has all the prices and information you need. The average cost for an electrical safety certificate for landlords is £265 but this will vary depending on the size of the property and other factors included in our guide.
As a landlord you’ll be responsible for keeping your properties in tip top condition. This ensures your tenants have a pleasant place to live and that they’re as safe as possible. The average homeowner pays £848 on property maintenance a year so ensure you budget for this. Our  property maintenance cost guide  is a great resource with average prices of different maintenance jobs. Which tradespeople should you use for the job? It’s crucial that your electrical safety checks are carried out by a qualified electrician. Not only is this the best way to protect your tenants and property but this is a legal requirement.

How to put up curtains,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/put-up-curtains/,Living Room,"How to put up curtains

In This Blog: Safety tips for putting up curtains How to hang net curtains How to hang pencil pleat curtains How to hang eyelet curtains How to put up curtains on uPVC windows How to hang pinch pleat curtains How to hang curtains on a pole How to hang curtains without drilling FAQs With several designs and materials on the market, knowing where to start when learning how to hang curtains can feel overwhelming. Thankfully, there are several methods that make hanging any type of curtain easier. However, if you’re looking for a crisp and professional finish, we recommend  hiring one of our trusted experts  to do the job for you.
Curtains block out light and give you more privacy. However, they’re also an interior design aesthetic that can transform a room. And not just the colour or fold of your curtains – the tracks and poles come in various options too, which gives you lots of scope when it comes to finding the right design for your tastes.
Check out our guide:  How much does curtain fitting cost?  for more information.  Safety tips for putting up curtains If you’re looking for ready-made curtains, make sure you choose your design before purchasing your track or pole. That way you know what track, pole, or fitting you need to buy before you drill into your wall. Don’t forget to check for pipes and cables using an electronic detector, and avoid drilling directly above or below light fittings and power sockets.
It’s worth noting that looped blind cords are potentially hazardous to babies and small children. Make sure you fit a safety device to the cord that is taut or out of reach on a chain break connector, cleat, or P-clip. Also, don’t place a cot, highchair, or any furniture near the curtain that a child could climb onto to reach the cord.

Hire a curtain fitter your neighbours trust  How to hang net curtains There are two common ways to hang net curtains:
Using a curtain wire; or
Using a tension rod
The most common way to hang a net curtain is to use curtain wire. It’s cheap, cost-effective, and easy to cut to the right measurement you need. Curtain wire is good for lightweight curtains like nets and voiles but isn’t great for heavyweight alternatives.
Attach the curtain wire to your window frame using the following steps:
If you have a wooden window frame, screw a small metal eye to the inside of the frame.
Next, screw a matching metal hook into each end of the wire. These can now screw into the metal eyes you’ve already attached to the frame.
The curtain wire inside the plastic casing will stretch slightly and offer some give to support the weight of the net.
For uPVC windows, avoid using a metal hook. Instead, purchase small self-adhesive pads with end supports included. This lets you attach the metal eyes to each end of the curtain wire and hang it from the end supports.
If you’ve opted for heavier net curtains, consider using a tension rod. They’re a sturdier and easy way to hang curtains and work well if you have a wide window. Tension rods work by holding themselves in place on either side of your window frame. Therefore, there’s no need for extra fittings or fixtures. They also come in various shapes, designs and sizes. All you have to do is twist it until it fits across your window and hold itself in place. How to hang pencil pleat curtains Pencil pleat curtains tend to have headings with three rows of ‘pockets’ where you insert plastic hooks. They’re then hung on curtain poles via rings with each hook threading through the top row of pockets so they hang just below the ring.
Top tip: To avoid any unnecessary gaping, evenly space the hooks across the width of the curtains.
Before hanging your curtains, measure the width of your pole to get the right measurement. Each curtain should be half the width of the pole.
Iron your curtains on the side with the lining to avoid accidents.
Tie the cords in a slip knot at each end before gathering up the curtain.
Put the hooks in the top, middle, or bottom pocket (not the cord!) between every third or fourth pocket.
Maintain your pleats by supporting the weight of the curtain when hanging it.
Attach the hooks to the rings on your pole. How to hang eyelet curtains If you want a fuss-free option, eyelet curtains are your best bet. They’re easy to hang and a perfect choice if you’re looking for a quick and simple project.
Thread your pole through the loops on the eyelet holes or ‘tab top’ curtains.
To anchor your curtains and stop them sliding all the way across your window, keep one tab or eyelet on either side of your end bracket.
Once you’ve hung your eyelet-headed curtains, they will pleat themselves into generous folds, which means you don’t have to dress them or fix their pleats.
Ideally, tab top curtains are best used as dress curtains. They might benefit from a pair of tiebacks to keep them away from the window, but they’re generally a low-maintenance option.

Hire a curtain fitter your neighbours trust  How to put up curtains on uPVC windows uPVC is able to support larger glass windows, which means hanging nets or curtains without using hooks or drilling into the uPVC frame is difficult. However, there are several ways to get around this issue and avoid damaging your frame.
Picture hooks
Using picture hooks above the window frame avoids causing damage to the uPVC, coupled with some no-nails glue to fix the hooks above the window. Another option is to use picture hooks to hoist the middle of the wire the net runs across and stop it from bowing in the middle.
Extendable rods
Another option that avoids damage to the uPVC is to use an extendable rod. As both ends of the rod push into the walls on either side of your window, the tension support allows your net curtains to hang from it with ease. Just make sure that when you buy a rod, it’s 1-2cm bigger than the window. This just means the tension is strong enough to ensure the rod stays up. To add the net, simply feed the rod through the top pocket. Reattach the rod and then gather the net along the pole until it looks how you want it.
Top tip:
Consider a spring-loaded rod, which tends to have greater levels of tension that better supports the net.
Right angle hooks
Although these are tricker than picture hooks and rods to install, they’re effective if installed properly. For this, you need a steady hand and a keen eye, and the trick is to make sure the hooks don’t go too far in and cause damage. Once they’re secured, a rod can sit on the hooks and hold up your net or curtain.
Install a uPVC window that supports curtain poles
Some makes of uPVC windows come with net curtain poles already glued to the frame. So, if you know you’re the kind of person who’s always going to want curtains or nets, make sure your installation includes this handy feature.

Hire a curtain fitter your neighbours trust  How to hang pinch pleat curtains To hang pinch pleat curtains, either use a regular curtain rod or opt for a traverse rod with gliders. Then, follow these steps:
Insert a hook into a curtain ring and measure the distance between the bottom of the hanging hook on the rod and the top of the curtain track/pole. This lets you determine how low the hooks need to be inserted to cover the rod from view.
Lay the curtain flat and attach curtain hooks to each panel that corresponds to the measurement you just took. Place one in each pleat and at either end. Test the panel by hanging the curtain and making sure the hooks are inserted at the right level. Adjust accordingly. Make sure the hooks are the same size and equally tight so the curtains don’t droop when you hang them.
Fold the space between each pleat before you hang the curtains. ‘Pinch’ and bunch the pleats as you. When you reach the end, use a ribbon to tie the curtain together and keep the pleats in place.
Hang each hook from the rings or gliders. Be careful and make sure you match every hook to its right spot. Support the curtain as you go to avoid breaking or damaging the hooks or rings. How to hang curtains on a pole Hanging curtains on a pole is usually a matter of threading them through eyelets or hooking them onto pockets or rings. Our guide:  How to put up a curtain pole  has everything you need to know about how to install a pole for various types of curtains. How to hang curtains without drilling If you’re looking for a way to hang curtains that doesn’t involve drilling, consider these options:
Use picture hooks or 3m command hooks
Opt for Kwik-Hang curtain rod brackets
Try a tension rod
Add a magnetic rod to a metal door FAQs Should I hire a professional?
If you’re wondering whether you should  hire a curtain hanging expert  or do the job yourself, we recommend assessing the job at hand and working out whether it requires a thorough or simple solution. If you’re looking for a professional and clean result, it’s worth hiring an expert to do it for you.
When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews. Even better, those reviews are from your neighbours and checked by us to make sure they’re legitimate.
How do you hang curtains for beginners?

How can I look after my curtains?
Regular cleaning and maintenance can keep your curtains looking their best. Take a look at our

In the first instance, it’s worth speaking to your friends and family to see whether they have any suggestions.
Alternatively, to save yourself the effort of contacting everyone you know, you can use our  free search feature . We’ll use your postcode to instantly find a variety of water filtration companies recommended by your neighbours. What to look for in the best water treatment company It’s so important to find a water treatment company you can trust to do a professional job. An excellent way to be sure you’re hiring the right tradespeople for your project is to look for a range of different traits and qualities. Ask each professional round for a quote and take a little time to chat and get to know each other.
You should then be able to pick up whether they are:
Reliable
Honest
Hardworking
Experienced
Knowledgeable

Questions to ask when hiring a tradesperson Asking questions is the best way to reassure yourself that you’re choosing the right person for your job. Most tradespeople will be happy to answer any questions you ask and to talk through any worries you have. If a professional seems annoyed or refuses to answer any queries, they may not be the best person to hire.
Below are a few example questions:
How long will it take to install my water filter/softener?
Can I see past customer reviews?
How many years have you been operating?
What insurance do you have?
Can I have a written quote?
Does the amount you’ve quoted include VAT?
How does the water filter/softener work?
What are the benefits of having this installed?
Do you offer a guarantee?

Thankfully, most professionals don’t fall into this category and are happy to offer an excellent service time after time.
So how can you avoid hiring a cowboy water filtration company? Look out for the following red flags:
Don’t hire any cold callers, especially if they come to your front door. This is a known way for con artists to operate.
Always ask to see past customer reviews. If the expert is unwilling to show you these, this is a clear warning sign.
Any tradesperson with more negative reviews than positive should generally be avoided.
If a professional won’t answer your questions or keeps brushing you off, this is a red flag.
Never be tempted to hire a worker who doesn’t have insurance.

How to boost your SEO with Checkatrade,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-boost-seo/,Tag Not Found,"How to boost your SEO with Checkatrade

Deciding how to boost SEO is a multi-billion pound industry, focused on improving websites against hundreds of different factors. It’s a complex process and often one where those with the biggest budgets get the best rewards. So how can you compete without spending a fortune?
Well, by  joining Checkatrade  we offer some great solutions to improve your rankings and gain new customers from search engines. Below, we’ve outlined how this is done as well as some top SEO advice for tradespeople and we take a look at what are the best local business SEO strategies.
What is SEO?
First, let’s take a step back for a moment and examine what SEO is. SEO stands for “search engine optimisation”. This term covers any activities done to help a website rank higher in search engines such as Google. This can include:
On page:
 Improving the content on your site and making sure it’s relevant for keywords you’d like to rank for. A key part of this is  keyword research .
Link building:
 Asking other sites to link to your website. This sends extra traffic and improves the authority of your site.
Technical SEO:
 Improving the way your site works. For example, you could make it more secure or load faster.
By covering these areas and working to improve them, you can attempt to boost the rankings of your website. Plus, you’ll also create content that’s relevant for users, and provide a better experience for visitors to your site, so there are additional benefits as well.
The below graphic shows some of the key areas:
What is local business SEO?
How can local businesses improve SEO? In addition to the above three areas, you can also deploy local SEO tactics to improve your rankings in a specific region of the UK. This helps reduce the area you’re focused on so you can find more locally relevant customers.
So, instead of trying to rank for “builder” which is highly competitive and will include many customers in regions you can’t serve, you would try and rank for “builder in Chichester” for example. This helps you reach a more targeted audience and is going to be easier to rank for. You’ll still be competing with other Chichester builders who also do local SEO, or have websites that rank well, and this is an area where Checkatrade can help – more on this later!
What is a local SEO strategy?
Some of the best local SEO tactics include:
Creating content that’s relevant to the local area.
Getting your company added to high quality directories, such as Checkatrade.
Ensuring your locations and contact details are mentioned on your website and elsewhere (also known as local SEO citations).
Getting local reviews.
You can learn more about SEO  via this resource from Moz .
Why is SEO important for tradespeople?
It’s never been easier to create a website and appear in search results, leading to a wealth of new businesses. But this increased competition also means it’s harder to stand out in a crowded market. After all, only one site can rank number one on Google for each term.
For this reason, SEO is important for tradespeople as it gives you the best possible chance to rank for the terms your prospective customers are searching for. It’s a myth that websites are automatically optimised for SEO. You have to put time and energy into SEO in order to get the best results.
That’s why people search for how to boost SEO. Because it’s an ongoing process and there’s always new content you could create, local SEO additions to make, or other ways you could optimise your site.
It’s worth noting that SEO for tradespeople, and any sector, is a long-term process. It takes time to make the improvements, for them to be accessed by search engines and for results to change.
This process is well worth it in the long run but if you need a quick solution, you could consider running paid adverts on search engines, which is also known as pay per click marketing. Our guide on  how Google and PPC works  is a great place to start.
How does Checkatrade boost SEO?
As we’ve established SEO for tradespeople is hard. It takes a lot of time and you’ll need a budget for SEO. If you don’t have the resources to do your own SEO, or funds to pay for an SEO agency, you could consider partnering with another site instead. But how can you leverage top sites to appear on Google search results?
One approach is  barnacle SEO . Much like how barnacles attach to bigger creatures and ships, you can place your brand on a larger site that does their own SEO. So instead of trying to rank for terms with your site, your aim is that the larger site will rank for the terms instead. It’s a fantastic solution for small businesses who don’t have the time or budget to compete.
One way you can do this is by  joining Checkatrade  and creating a profile. We have a highly skilled SEO team internally and work with other agencies to create hundreds of articles every month. As a result of this work, we currently rank for over 450,000 keywords* so reach customers in all sorts of regions and niches.
So, when people search for how to guides, cost guides, design inspiration, landlord advice, expert advice pieces and industry news, there’s a good chance they’ll see a piece of Checkatrade content. From those pieces they can search our database of tradespeople, helping our members to get more business thanks to our SEO efforts. It’s no wonder our team were shortlisted for the UK Content Award in 2021.
In addition to our content, we have category pages for different regions (e.g. plumber in Southampton). These pages help our members with local SEO, as we target regional terms and put Checkatrade members in the results when people are in need of help.
Lastly, all our member pages are optimised in line with SEO best practice, increasing the chance you’ll appear for the terms people are searching for. Sound good? Then why not  start your profile today ?

What are local SEO citations and the benefits of service reviews?
Local SEO citations are a key part of SEO for trades, as well as any good local SEO strategy. They include all of the times when another website mentions your contact details and company name. These citations help show you’re a real business and give you added authority.
Service reviews are also known as review snippets, a type of rich snippet. They are reviews of your services that can appear directly in the search results. These can be taken from your own site (with the right markup), your Checkatrade profile, or other sources. For more details read our  rich snippets guide .
Will you do SEO on my website?
Whilst we can help your business get known on search engines through our content and profile pages, we can’t do SEO on your website. We do however have details on excellent web designers in the UK that you can  browse here in our directory .
Will you replace my SEO agency?
No, we wouldn’t recommend you stop other existing SEO work even if you add a Checkatrade profile. It’s still important to optimise your own website where possible, especially if you already use an agency and are happy with them.
How can I learn more about SEO?
We highly recommend the  learn SEO guide from Moz  who’ve been helping people learn about SEO for over 15 years. Best of all, it’s absolutely free.
How can you leverage top sites to appear on Google search results?
With barnacle SEO, if you can get listed on another site that already ranks well you can appear when people are reading their content. By appearing on Checkatrade you’ll gain the benefit of our strong performing site, increasing the chance your Checkatrade listing will appear in search engines.
Useful checklist to boost your SEO with Checkatrade
To boost SEO, you need to improve your content, link building, and technical SEO.
Local SEO is an excellent way to improve your rankings locally.
By  joining Checkatrade  you get a well optimised profile page and the chance to receive new customers from our content.
We won’t replace your SEO agency but are a great low cost way for you to get more customers from search engines with Checkatrade acting as an intermediary.

Commercial vs domestic electricians,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/commercial-vs-domestic-electricians/,Tag Not Found,"Commercial vs domestic electricians

Electricians are known for installing and maintaining a wide range of different electrical systems. So, you might be wondering why there are both commercial and domestic sectors – surely, they are largely the same? While these two trades share a lot of similarities, there are also some distinctions to be aware of.
Different buildings demand different skills, so it’s important to understand where commercial and domestic electricians work best. You might be an experienced tradesperson looking to start your own business, new to the industry and looking for some tips, or even expanding your existing company to attract more customers. Either way, this article covers everything you need to know.
In a hurry and want some quick answers to the most common questions? Scroll down to the FAQs section below.
What is a domestic electrician?
Domestic electricians carry out electrical work mostly inside residential flats and houses. This can involve running cables, installing lighting, replacing fuse boxes and repairing electrical parts around the home.
Some rooms will have different requirements. For example, bathroom electrics won’t be set up in the same way as a kitchen – this means domestic electricians have the freedom to specialise in different areas of a home. Along with technical know-how, residential electricians will also be knowledgeable when it comes to complying with building regulations for domestic electrical systems.
With the rising popularity of electric cars in the UK, domestic electricians can now even install residential vehicle charging points as part of their service. For more information on this line of work, read our article  here .
Qualifications
Domestic electricians aren’t necessarily fully qualified. Those who aren’t in possession of the required qualifications are known as domestic electrical installers – these trades can carry out work on homes if they’re a member of the  Competent Persons Scheme . This includes a register of individuals that have demonstrated the skills and experience necessary to offer basic installation work.
Fully qualified domestic electricians will have undergone more thorough training and hold a Level 2 or Level 3 Diploma in Electrical Installation. It’s the most demanding career path in the sector and usually follows an apprenticeship or some form of long-term shadowed work.
Those who have completed the classroom and workshop levels will then need to be assessed at their place of work before taking the AM2 exam at a local test centre. You can read more about that  here .
What are commercial electricians?
Commercial electricians are professionals that complete electrical work for other businesses. This includes offices, schools, restaurants, shops and data centres. They may even extend their work to industrial environments such as factories, though this may require some engineering expertise. As with domestic jobs, commercial electricians have certain standards and regulations they must follow to make sure installations are safe and compliant.
Electrical work within commercial properties can include dealing with server rooms, backup generators, power supplies and industrial control panels. Other work may involve carrying out inspection reports, installing lighting and testing electrical appliances.
Qualifications
Commercial electricians have to be fully qualified. This means they will need to hold a Level 3 Diploma in Electrical Installation and another technical qualification. This can be either Level 3 NVQ Diploma in Electrotechnical Services or a Level 3 NVQ Diploma in Installing Electrotechnical Systems & Equipment.
Skilled tradespeople get your business started 
Join Checkatrade today  Join Now What is the difference between commercial and domestic electricians?
Domestic and commercial properties have different regulations, so electricians won’t necessarily have the same knowledge of building legislation and safety standards if they specialise in separate fields. For example, commercial electricians will have to follow  The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 .
Installations
There’s also a big difference between domestic and commercial electrical installation. Commercial electricians sometimes have to deal with high voltage power supplies, unlike residential electricians who are mainly dealing with 230 volts. Due to the high voltage in commercial settings, the wiring setup for electrical work is also different to what’s found in the home. Households require one power phase, while commercial buildings are supplied with a three-phase wiring design.
Services
The types of work that commercial and residential electricians carry out might sometimes overlap but there are key differences. While they may both install lighting, complete wiring and carry out electrical repairs, commercial electricians have to work on various systems and appliances you wouldn’t find in a home. Plus, these units and systems will need to be professionally tested, which isn’t always a requirement for residences.
Clients
Domestic electricians are likely to be hired for smaller jobs by individual homeowners, while commercial electricians could be contracted by companies for larger projects within their offices or shops. Whichever the case, these are both valuable sources of work for electricians and can make starting your own business a potentially lucrative opportunity. For more information on becoming a self-employed electrician, read our guide  here .
FAQs
What pays more commercial or residential electrician?
If you look at commercial vs domestic electrician salary, it seems that residential electrician work usually pays slightly more. On average, a commercial electrician earns £37,000 a year, while a domestic electrician earns about £37,500 per year. Of course, these are just averages and the amount you could make as a successful self-employed trade could be much higher.
What can domestic electricians do? 
This will depend on whether they are trained as a domestic electrical installer or a fully qualified domestic electrician. Installers can carry out:
Wiring in plumbing, heating and other appliances
Testing the safety of existing electrical installations
Testing the safety of new electrical installations
Testing the safety of portable appliances
Domestic electricians on the other hand can complete more major work, such as installing a home’s electrical system or repairing complex appliances.
Can a commercial electrician do domestic work?
Commercial electricians have the same diploma in electrical installation as domestic electricians, as well as further training on top of this. Seeing as they have more qualifications, they should be fully able to carry out domestic work if needed.
What is the difference between residential and commercial wiring?
Commercial buildings usually have more wires than residential properties and these come with added protection. Domestic wires only require plastic sheathing, while commercial applications are contained in conduits or ceiling rafters. The wiring setups also differ as commercial properties tend to need more electrical power than homes.

Does a new roof add value to a UK home?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/new-roof-add-value-uk-home/,Roof,"Does a new roof add value to a UK home?

In This Blog:
How does a new roof add value to a home?  How much does a new roof cost? Do I need a new roof? Whatever the reason for replacing your roof, you may be wondering if a new roof will add value to your home. The simple answer is, it won’t. However, it will make sure that you don’t lose value on your home.
A better way to look at the investment of a new roof is that it will stop you from losing money in any home valuation or sale, and it could save you huge repair costs later down the line.
Even though a new roof doesn’t necessarily ‘add value’ to your home, here’s why it’s still worth the investment.
How does a new roof add value to a home? 
A new roof can potentially add value for a number of reasons, mainly:
Structural reasons
Aesthetics
The resale market
Function of the house
Your roof is in the firing line, protecting your home from rain, wind, snow, and everything else in between. A damaged roof can lead to severe, and costly, problems within your home caused by rotten framing or roof leaks. A new roof will give you peace of mind that you’re safeguarding the structural integrity of your home.
A new roof can also add value to your home by increasing its energy efficiency. It will retain the heat better, which means less energy is needed to heat your home and therefore your energy bills will be less.
Improved appearance
A well-maintained roof can last around 20 years, but the signs of ageing may still be obvious on an older roof. A new roof will help to improve the overall appearance of your home and instantly update an older property.
If you’re building an extension, consider how the old will blend with the new. Many homeowners opt for a full roof replacement during an extension for a cohesive end result.
Home value
If you’re thinking of  putting your home on the market , a new roof can boost its sale value by increasing its curb appeal.
Prospective buyers will be encouraged to know the roof has been recently replaced, meaning they won’t need to budget for roof repairs or replacement for a while. This in turn means you’re more likely to get the full asking price for your property, a quicker sale, and smoother negotiations.

Find a roofer your neighbours recommend  How much does a new roof cost? The cost of a new roof will depend on a couple of different factors, including the design of the roof, the roof tiles used, the size of the roof, and where you live.
On average, a new roof will cost around 
£5,000 – £8,000
.
The cost to remove the existing roof before replacing it with new is around
 £1,000 – £2,500
.
There are a number of costs to budget for when planning your  roof installation  project:
Materials
To give you an idea of the cost of materials, a slate roof costs on average between 
£2,800 – £5,000
 on a standard house build.
Plain roofing tiles normally cost around 
£80 per m2
. Clay roof tiles come in at around 
£120 per m2
, while rubber roof installation is around 
£80 – £100 per m2
. Tin roof installation (for outbuildings such as garden sheds, garages, or workspaces) costs around 
£50 – £65 per m2
.
For more information on the various types of roofing material, read our post on  roof replacement cost .
Labour
A roofer’s day rate is normally between 
£150 – £250
.
Your roofer will quote for the cost of removing the existing roof and installing the new one.
Additional costs
Aside from labour and materials, you may also need to factor in the cost of: Scaffolding Skip hire Structural works, e.g. trusses, rafters, battens, and joists
Ply
Insulation
Waterproof membrane and felt
Soffits and fascias
Rainwater gutters and downpipes
Leadwork
To get an accurate quote for the cost of a new roof, use our  request a quote  feature to get at least three quotes from local roofing experts in your area. Do I need a new roof? The warning signs that suggest you might need a new roof include:
Damaged tiles
They could be cracked, rotten, buckled, torn, missing, worn, curled or loose.
Misshapen, sunken or missing tiles
This could be due to structural sagging, which is a serious concern. Contact a  local roofer  who can investigate this safely for you. They can also check whether the underlay is damaged or rotten.
Water damage or mould
If you’ve noticed water stains or mould on your interior walls or the ceiling, it’s likely to be due to a leak. If you’re able to, check the loft to find out where the water is entering your property.
Streaks of light coming into the loft
You should not be able to see daylight through your roof (unless looking through a Velux!). If you can see streaks of light coming through the roof, contact a roofing specialist asap.
Worn chimney flashing
Roof flashing is the grey material between the tiles and a hard structure, such as the chimney stack or roof vents. Its purpose is to maintain a watertight roof. If roof flashing becomes loose or worn over time, water will penetrate through the roof and into your home.
If your roof is more than 20 years old, or you notice any of the warning signs listed above, it might be time for a new roof. Not only will this give you peace of mind as to the structural integrity of your property, and the roof’s ability to keep the elements out, it will also add value to your home.
Roofing is a specialist skill and involves working at height, therefore this work should always be carried out by a qualified roofer.

How to install a handrail in 6 easy steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/install-handrail/,Tag Not Found,"How to install a handrail in 6 easy steps

In This Blog: How to install a handrail How to install a handrail on your stairway FAQs Are you looking to install a handrail but not sure where to begin? Our how to install a handrail guide has everything you need to know about installation and the required building regulations.
Most stairways with two or more steps need to be equipped with a safety measurement in the form of a handrail or guardrail, which gives people ascending and descending the stairs extra security.
These regulations tend to apply to both indoor and outdoor stairways:
If stairs are more than 1m wide, they need to include a handrail on at least one side.
The height of the handrail needs to be between 90cm and 100cm from the top of the rail to the pitch (rake) line.
The handrails need to be fashioned so a person can grip them tightly if need be.
A handrail can’t have any protrusions on either end that pose a safety risk.
The handrail should be able to withstand a weight of around 200lbs when applied in a downward or outward direction. The ability to support that weight needs to be maintained within 2 inches of the top edge of the rail.
Don’t forget to check out our blog about  handrail installation cost  and  glass stair railing cost  for information about pricing up your project.

Find neighbours know and trust  How to install a handrail There are various types of handrails on the market to match your style and tastes. You may think that installing these necessities is an easy job; however, due to the safety requirements, it can be a bigger job than it seems.
For example, you need to place sturdy brackets to studs or posts to anchor the handrail, and they need to line up with the tread of your stairs. As a result, careful measurements will be required to make sure it’s in the right position.
The easiest way to meet your building requirements and install a handrail is to buy a pre-built handrail bar, cut it to length, and attach it to the wall studs with sturdy brackets. Although this option is quick and inexpensive, it’s not always the most attractive finish.
For guaranteed style and safety, why not hire one of our  handrail installation experts ? When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews.
If you’re still looking to install a handrail yourself, read on for the tools you’ll need and the steps you need to follow.
Tools you’ll need for the job
Stud finder
Pencil
Tape measure
Masking tape (optional)
Spirit level
Mitre saw
Drill and bits
Screwdriver
Pretreated handrail
Handrail brackets
1/2-inch stainless steel wood screws

Find neighbours know and trust  How to install a handrail on your stairway Whether you’re looking for how to install a handrail on a wall,  how to install a handrail on a deck , or how to install a basement stair handrail, these instructions have you covered.
Step one: Find and mark the studs
Take your stud finder and turn it on. Following the user manual’s instructions, locate the studs on your stairway to find the best locations for the brackets and mark with a pencil. You want to make sure your brackets are no less than four feet apart. Any more than this risks an unsteady finish. Place the brackets about 30cm from the top and bottom of the handrail, and include one in the centre.
Once you’ve marked the locations, use your spirit level to mark vertical lines that let you know where the centre of each stud needs to go. If you don’t want to mark your wall, use some masking tape.
Note:
With open or exposed stairways that have balusters, the brackets might need to go on the newel posts instead of the wall studs.
Step two: Cut the handrail to the right length
Now you’ve completed your measurements and marking, it’s time to measure and cut your handrail to the right length. To make it easy to grip, extend the handrail beyond the top and bottom steps. Keep it an equal distance to the width of a stair tread.
Top tip:
Use a mitre saw to cut each end of the handrail to make a vertical edge perpendicular to the floor.
Step three: Mark out the height of the handrail
Take your tape measure and spirit level and mark the wall your handrail is being attached about 36 inches from the nose of the stair treads, including the top, bottom, and middle of the handrail’s location. This creates reference marks that reveal the location of the top edge of the handrail. To ensure the right height, these vertical marks are the most important to get right. The regulations ask that the height of the rail remains between 90cm and 100cm from the top of the rail to the pitch (rake) line.
Step four: Mark out where the brackets are going to go
You might need to ask someone to help you with this step as it requires you to hold the handrail against the wall, making sure the top edge matches the reference marks you drew. This lets you draw the bottom reference marks on the handrail (the point where the handrail intersects the lines marking the studs) and show you where the top of the support brackets need to go.
Step five:  Secure the brackets to the wall
Now you know where to position the brackets, use your reference marks to attach them to the wall using your screwdriver and screws. Make sure the tops of the brackets are flush with the bottom edge of the handrail.
Step six: Attach the handrail to the brackets
Once your brackets are in position, attach your handrail on top of them, leaving enough overhang at the top and bottom. To secure the handrail, use the support brackets that have U-shaped sleeves around the arms and use your drill to tightly screw them in. It’s worth drilling pilot holes if you have wooden handrails.
Voila! You’ve just secured your handrail.

Find neighbours know and trust  FAQs Should I hire a professional?
For the best results, we recommend hiring a  handrail installation expert . This will ensure that your handrail is secure and sturdy and meets building regulations.
When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews. Even better, those reviews are from your neighbours and checked by us to make sure they’re legitimate.
How can I install a handrail and balusters?
Installing balusters as well as a handrail is a  job for a professional . Balusters are a trickier installation due to their fiddly nature. As a result, getting a perfect finish isn’t as easy as it seems. However, if you do want to attempt adding them yourself, make sure you space them no more than 4 inches apart. They also need to be able to withstand 50 pounds of pressure. Take a look at our  banister and spindle costs .
What height should a handrail be?
Handrails need to be between 90 and 100cm from the pitch line (the invisible line that runs from the lip of a stair to another one) to the top of the rail.
Where should a handrail start and end?
Handrails need to follow the pitch line from the bottom of the stairs to the top.

Nothing bespoke about the rogue builder that left Manchester teacher out of pocket,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cowboys/nothing-bespoke-about-the-rogu/,Tag Not Found,"Nothing bespoke about the rogue builder that left Manchester teacher out of pocket

Dan Brown, 40 from Manchester wanted a tradesperson to build bespoke fitted wardrobes for his 8-year-old daughter’s bedroom. He turned to Facebook on the assumption that local recommendations would see him work with a reputable builder.
As a result, Dan found someone who appeared to have lots of positive reviews across a range of jobs from bespoke furniture to building work and quoted Daniel £1,700 for work and materials.
Dan hired him and as requested, paid £800 up front for the price of materials however only days later, he was then asked for another £300 for materials and was told that materials had ‘shot up in price’. Whilst Dan questioned this, he said he took the man on face value and trusted him and agreed a further £150 up front giving him the benefit of the doubt.
The job started and Dan returned from work only to find cheap plywood materials for the framework and doors had been purchased – not those agreed or paid for. More worryingly, the bedroom wall was full of holes where the builder claimed he was trying to find the hard part of the walls to secure the structure onto.
Dan knew this wasn’t right despite the builder insisting the structural damage was ok and that it didn’t matter as the wardrobe would hide it.
Following the incorrect materials, promises the wall being fixed and being led in circles, the builder stopped taking Dan’s calls. The trade then refused to come back to complete the work and accused Dan of changing the parameters of the job leaving Dan significantly out of pocket.
Dan’s daughter is now the proud owner of built-in wardrobes thanks to Checkatrade where he was able to find a father and son duo who after hearing his story, did the work at cost price. He has since recommended them to his parents, brother and friends for their own bespoke builds.
Dan said, “
Going with a Facebook recommended tradesperson I thought I would be in good hands however I realised there is no proof of credibility on there – it could be their friends or family writing it and duping honest paying customers. The opportunity for credible and verified reviews with a guarantee would have saved time and money and is something definitely needed. I was lucky in that I found great tradespeople to finish the job without being too out of pocket in the end however not everyone is so lucky”.

6.7 million people have been impacted by a rogue trade in the last year,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cowboys/6-7-million-people-have-been-affected-by-a-rogue-trade-in-the-last-year/,Tag Not Found,"6.7 million people have been impacted by a rogue trade in the last year

We’ve carried out new research which has revealed a staggering 6.7 million UK adults* have been impacted by a rogue trade over the last year.
Increasing demand for tradespeople, Brexit and the ongoing raw materials shortage have placed a huge amount of pressure on the home improvement industry, creating the ideal environment for rogue trades to step in and take advantage.
This perfect storm has caused 1 in 3 UK adults to put off home improvement work for fear of hiring a rogue trade.
Mike Fairman, CEO, Checkatrade said
, “
Checkatrade is renowned for stamping out rogue trades.
For 22 years we’ve made it our mission to eliminate the cowboys – we won’t stand for poor workmanship, overcharging or pressuring homeowners in undertaking unnecessary work. In fact, i
n the last three years alone we have removed almost 5,000 tradespeople from our platform who failed to keep up our high standards.
“We’re proud to help homeowners connect with reputable, checked trades – but if you’re one of the 1 in 5 people who would consider using an unverified trade, beware that it’s not as easy as you might think to spot the cowboys from the good guys.” 
Rogue trade watch outs
Electrical (21%), roofing (21%), building (20%) and plumbing (20%) have been found to be the most common home improvement work affected by rogue trades. With 55% of people not confident they can spot a cowboy from a verified trade, Checkatrade share their key watch outs for homeowners:
Be wary of high availability
: Some unverified trades will take advantage of busy periods or moments of crisis such as extreme weather. Read reviews, and ensure trades are vetted and qualified to undertake the requested work.
Be careful of cheap quotes: 
If the cost seems too good to be true, it most likely is. The cheapest quote is normally only cheaper because it’s been  rushed or corners have been cut . Remember, cheap work can’t always be rectified.
Beware of being asked for full payment upfront:
 Don’t agree to making full payment in advance of work being undertaken.  Get a detailed written quote  that includes T&Cs and states what will be covered by the quote – and what won’t.
NEVER accept work from trades who ‘doorstep’
: 44% of people have been doorstepped – but reputable trades will NEVER carry out this practice. Checkatrade has zero tolerance of any member found to be canvassing door-to-door. Never be pressured in to having work done by someone who knocks on your door.
Checkatrade’s guarantee
As well as ‘Eliminating Rogue Trades’, Checkatrade has also  launched a new guarantee . This offers homeowners who book a job via Checkatrade up to £1,000 if their job doesn’t go to plan.

Could you spot a rogue trade?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cowboys/could-you-spot-a-rogue-trade/,Tag Not Found,"Could you spot a rogue trade?

Are you one of the 1 in 5 people who would consider chancing it with an unverified trade? Beware! It’s not as easy as you might think to spot the cowboys from the good guys.
Perhaps surprisingly 45% of people think they could spot a cowboy from a verified trade, but with 6.7 million of us caught out by a cowboy in the last year – it might not be as easy as you think. Rogue trades are everywhere, but electrical (21%), roofing (21%), building (20%) and plumbing (20%) have been found to be the most common home improvement work affected by cowboy trades.
Here are our top four tips for keeping the cowboys at bay:

Landlord electrical responsibilities,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/landlord-electrical-responsibilities/,"Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Landlord electrical responsibilities

In This Blog: What are landlord electrical safety certificates? New landlord electrical regulations Electrical checks and testing for landlords Need an electrical safety check? How much does an electrical safety check cost? Which tradespeople should you use for the job? As a landlord, you have a responsibility to keep tenants safe inside your properties from electrical injuries. So, what exactly are your landlord electrical responsibilities?
Well, you need to arrange for an  electrical safety check  to be carried out every 5 years. You also need to ensure this is done by a properly qualified electrician. Remember, you’re responsible for protecting your tenants from burns, shocks, fires, and explosions.
If any issues are found during the check, you’ll be responsible for repairs. This may include repairing wiring, damaged sockets and faulty fuse boxes. What are landlord electrical safety certificates? Once a safety check has been carried out by a competent electrician, you’ll be issued an electrical safety certificate. This document is evidence that the property you rent out is safe for your tenants. It covers essential electrical checks, such as wiring, sockets and lighting. The certificate also lists any improvements you need to make.
Legally, this certificate needs to cover any electrical risks, whether the capacity of the electric circuits is strong enough, if there’s a poor standard of electrical work, and whether the electrics are correctly earthed.
Make sure you have an up-to-date certificate, that you provide a copy to new or existing tenants, and that you’re prepared to show this to local authorities if they request it.

Find an electrical safety check expert  New landlord electrical regulations In 2020 a range of new electrical regulations for landlords came into play that legally you need to follow.
As well as getting safety checks every five years, these regulations state that you need to ensure you meet the standards in the 18
th
 edition of the Wiring Regulations. What’s more, any risks or concerns highlighted by your safety check need to be addressed within 28 days.
When it comes to appliances, the law is a little ambiguous. It’s not a legal requirement that you get any appliances in your property checked, however, you’re still responsible for these appliances and need to ensure they’re safe to use.
For further guidance on the new landlord electrical regulations, please visit the  Gov.uk page  where these are explained in more detail. Electrical checks and testing for landlords While you’re only required to get an electrical safety check every five years, there are a number of electrical checks and testing that landlords can carry out during inspections. You don’t need to be an electrician to perform these checks and you may help prevent an accident.
Consider checking the following as part of your property inspections:
Whether power sockets are working
Whether any lights are flickering
Whether there are any stains or brown marks next to power sockets
Whether any electrical items are crackling
Whether any fuses have been tripped
Whether any power sockets give out sparks when used
Whether any appliances have stopped working
Whether there are any exposed wires
Whether any switches aren’t working Need an electrical safety check? As a responsible landlord, you’ll want to have your properties checked every five years by a competent and qualified electrician. But  how can you find an electrician you can trust ?
Well, our members are thoroughly checked to ensure you get the best service possible. With recommendations from your neighbours, you can be sure you’re hiring the right worker for your job.
We’re so confident in our members’ abilities that we’re now offering a  guarantee  that provides up to £1,000 of cover to put things right in the unlikely event something goes wrong. What’s more, this guarantee is completely free, as long as you use an eligible trade. To find a range of local electricians, just use our  free search feature  to save yourself time and energy.
Looking for more tips and guidance when choosing an expert for your job? The  HomeOwners Alliance  website is packed with information plus DIY guides for home projects. How much does an electrical safety check cost? Once you’re ready to go ahead with your electrical safety check, it may be handy to know how much you need to budget for this. Our  electrical safety check cost guide  has all the prices and information you need. The average cost for an electrical safety certificate for landlords is £265 but this will vary depending on the size of the property and other factors included in our guide.
As a landlord you’ll be responsible for keeping your properties in tip top condition. This ensures your tenants have a pleasant place to live and that they’re as safe as possible. The average homeowner pays £848 on property maintenance a year so ensure you budget for this. Our  property maintenance cost guide  is a great resource with average prices of different maintenance jobs. Which tradespeople should you use for the job? It’s crucial that your electrical safety checks are carried out by a qualified electrician. Not only is this the best way to protect your tenants and property but this is a legal requirement.

How to put up curtains,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/put-up-curtains/,Living Room,"How to put up curtains

In This Blog: Safety tips for putting up curtains How to hang net curtains How to hang pencil pleat curtains How to hang eyelet curtains How to put up curtains on uPVC windows How to hang pinch pleat curtains How to hang curtains on a pole How to hang curtains without drilling FAQs With several designs and materials on the market, knowing where to start when learning how to hang curtains can feel overwhelming. Thankfully, there are several methods that make hanging any type of curtain easier. However, if you’re looking for a crisp and professional finish, we recommend  hiring one of our trusted experts  to do the job for you.
Curtains block out light and give you more privacy. However, they’re also an interior design aesthetic that can transform a room. And not just the colour or fold of your curtains – the tracks and poles come in various options too, which gives you lots of scope when it comes to finding the right design for your tastes.
Check out our guide:  How much does curtain fitting cost?  for more information.  Safety tips for putting up curtains If you’re looking for ready-made curtains, make sure you choose your design before purchasing your track or pole. That way you know what track, pole, or fitting you need to buy before you drill into your wall. Don’t forget to check for pipes and cables using an electronic detector, and avoid drilling directly above or below light fittings and power sockets.
It’s worth noting that looped blind cords are potentially hazardous to babies and small children. Make sure you fit a safety device to the cord that is taut or out of reach on a chain break connector, cleat, or P-clip. Also, don’t place a cot, highchair, or any furniture near the curtain that a child could climb onto to reach the cord.

Hire a curtain fitter your neighbours trust  How to hang net curtains There are two common ways to hang net curtains:
Using a curtain wire; or
Using a tension rod
The most common way to hang a net curtain is to use curtain wire. It’s cheap, cost-effective, and easy to cut to the right measurement you need. Curtain wire is good for lightweight curtains like nets and voiles but isn’t great for heavyweight alternatives.
Attach the curtain wire to your window frame using the following steps:
If you have a wooden window frame, screw a small metal eye to the inside of the frame.
Next, screw a matching metal hook into each end of the wire. These can now screw into the metal eyes you’ve already attached to the frame.
The curtain wire inside the plastic casing will stretch slightly and offer some give to support the weight of the net.
For uPVC windows, avoid using a metal hook. Instead, purchase small self-adhesive pads with end supports included. This lets you attach the metal eyes to each end of the curtain wire and hang it from the end supports.
If you’ve opted for heavier net curtains, consider using a tension rod. They’re a sturdier and easy way to hang curtains and work well if you have a wide window. Tension rods work by holding themselves in place on either side of your window frame. Therefore, there’s no need for extra fittings or fixtures. They also come in various shapes, designs and sizes. All you have to do is twist it until it fits across your window and hold itself in place. How to hang pencil pleat curtains Pencil pleat curtains tend to have headings with three rows of ‘pockets’ where you insert plastic hooks. They’re then hung on curtain poles via rings with each hook threading through the top row of pockets so they hang just below the ring.
Top tip: To avoid any unnecessary gaping, evenly space the hooks across the width of the curtains.
Before hanging your curtains, measure the width of your pole to get the right measurement. Each curtain should be half the width of the pole.
Iron your curtains on the side with the lining to avoid accidents.
Tie the cords in a slip knot at each end before gathering up the curtain.
Put the hooks in the top, middle, or bottom pocket (not the cord!) between every third or fourth pocket.
Maintain your pleats by supporting the weight of the curtain when hanging it.
Attach the hooks to the rings on your pole. How to hang eyelet curtains If you want a fuss-free option, eyelet curtains are your best bet. They’re easy to hang and a perfect choice if you’re looking for a quick and simple project.
Thread your pole through the loops on the eyelet holes or ‘tab top’ curtains.
To anchor your curtains and stop them sliding all the way across your window, keep one tab or eyelet on either side of your end bracket.
Once you’ve hung your eyelet-headed curtains, they will pleat themselves into generous folds, which means you don’t have to dress them or fix their pleats.
Ideally, tab top curtains are best used as dress curtains. They might benefit from a pair of tiebacks to keep them away from the window, but they’re generally a low-maintenance option.

Hire a curtain fitter your neighbours trust  How to put up curtains on uPVC windows uPVC is able to support larger glass windows, which means hanging nets or curtains without using hooks or drilling into the uPVC frame is difficult. However, there are several ways to get around this issue and avoid damaging your frame.
Picture hooks
Using picture hooks above the window frame avoids causing damage to the uPVC, coupled with some no-nails glue to fix the hooks above the window. Another option is to use picture hooks to hoist the middle of the wire the net runs across and stop it from bowing in the middle.
Extendable rods
Another option that avoids damage to the uPVC is to use an extendable rod. As both ends of the rod push into the walls on either side of your window, the tension support allows your net curtains to hang from it with ease. Just make sure that when you buy a rod, it’s 1-2cm bigger than the window. This just means the tension is strong enough to ensure the rod stays up. To add the net, simply feed the rod through the top pocket. Reattach the rod and then gather the net along the pole until it looks how you want it.
Top tip:
Consider a spring-loaded rod, which tends to have greater levels of tension that better supports the net.
Right angle hooks
Although these are tricker than picture hooks and rods to install, they’re effective if installed properly. For this, you need a steady hand and a keen eye, and the trick is to make sure the hooks don’t go too far in and cause damage. Once they’re secured, a rod can sit on the hooks and hold up your net or curtain.
Install a uPVC window that supports curtain poles
Some makes of uPVC windows come with net curtain poles already glued to the frame. So, if you know you’re the kind of person who’s always going to want curtains or nets, make sure your installation includes this handy feature.

Hire a curtain fitter your neighbours trust  How to hang pinch pleat curtains To hang pinch pleat curtains, either use a regular curtain rod or opt for a traverse rod with gliders. Then, follow these steps:
Insert a hook into a curtain ring and measure the distance between the bottom of the hanging hook on the rod and the top of the curtain track/pole. This lets you determine how low the hooks need to be inserted to cover the rod from view.
Lay the curtain flat and attach curtain hooks to each panel that corresponds to the measurement you just took. Place one in each pleat and at either end. Test the panel by hanging the curtain and making sure the hooks are inserted at the right level. Adjust accordingly. Make sure the hooks are the same size and equally tight so the curtains don’t droop when you hang them.
Fold the space between each pleat before you hang the curtains. ‘Pinch’ and bunch the pleats as you. When you reach the end, use a ribbon to tie the curtain together and keep the pleats in place.
Hang each hook from the rings or gliders. Be careful and make sure you match every hook to its right spot. Support the curtain as you go to avoid breaking or damaging the hooks or rings.

How to find the best water treatment and filtration companies,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/hiring-guides/best-water-treatment-company/,"Bathroom, Kitchen","How to find the best water treatment and filtration companies

In This Blog: Finding the best water filtration company locally What to look for in the best water treatment company Questions to ask when hiring a tradesperson Red flags to avoid Find a trustworthy water treatment company on Checkatrade How much does professional water softener installation cost? Which tradespeople should you use for the job? Unfortunately, many homes throughout the UK are affected by hard water. This causes a build-up of limescale, watermarks and bad-tasting tap water. If you’re fed up with buying bottled water and constantly descaling your kettle, why not hire a professional to upgrade your water supply? This article covers everything you need to know about finding the best water treatment company.
We’ll be looking at ways to find local water treatment companies,  what to look for in a tradesperson , example questions and common red flags. Let’s get started by discussing how to find the best water treatment company.
The following are all great indicators of whether you should work with a company:
They have lots of positive customer reviews or testimonials
They can show you photos of past work
They have the right type of insurance
They’re experienced and knowledgeable
They’re friendly and you feel comfortable with them
They’ll give you a written quote
They’re happy to answer any questions you have

Find water filtration companies your neighbours rate  Finding the best water filtration company locally Keeping the above points in mind, you’ll need to now find the best water filtration company locally to conduct the work. In the first instance, it’s worth speaking to your friends and family to see whether they have any suggestions.
Alternatively, to save yourself the effort of contacting everyone you know, you can use our  free search feature . We’ll use your postcode to instantly find a variety of water filtration companies recommended by your neighbours. What to look for in the best water treatment company It’s so important to find a water treatment company you can trust to do a professional job. An excellent way to be sure you’re hiring the right tradespeople for your project is to look for a range of different traits and qualities. Ask each professional round for a quote and take a little time to chat and get to know each other.
You should then be able to pick up whether they are:
Reliable
Honest
Hardworking
Experienced
Knowledgeable
Open to questions
Friendly
Qualified
Please note, another way to learn more about your water filtration company is to look at past customer reviews. You can even ask for references if you have any concerns. Questions to ask when hiring a tradesperson Asking questions is the best way to reassure yourself that you’re choosing the right person for your job. Most tradespeople will be happy to answer any questions you ask and to talk through any worries you have. If a professional seems annoyed or refuses to answer any queries, they may not be the best person to hire.
Below are a few example questions:
How long will it take to install my water filter/softener?
Can I see past customer reviews?
How many years have you been operating?
What insurance do you have?
Can I have a written quote?
Does the amount you’ve quoted include VAT?
How does the water filter/softener work?
What are the benefits of having this installed?
Do you offer a guarantee?
When will you start work on my filter/softener? Red flags to avoid Hiring a tradesperson to work in your home can be a little risky when you consider that rogue traders exist in every profession. Thankfully, most professionals don’t fall into this category and are happy to offer an excellent service time after time.
So how can you avoid hiring a cowboy water filtration company? Look out for the following red flags:
Don’t hire any cold callers, especially if they come to your front door. This is a known way for con artists to operate.
Always ask to see past customer reviews. If the expert is unwilling to show you these, this is a clear warning sign.
Any tradesperson with more negative reviews than positive should generally be avoided.
If a professional won’t answer your questions or keeps brushing you off, this is a red flag.
Never be tempted to hire a worker who doesn’t have insurance.
If your neighbours or family members have had a bad experience with a tradesperson, this should make you think twice about hiring them. Find a trustworthy water treatment company on Checkatrade We know that inviting a stranger into your home can be daunting and that’s why our members pass 12 thorough background checks. This ensures you always get the best service and experience possible.

How to boost your SEO with Checkatrade,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-boost-seo/,Tag Not Found,"How to boost your SEO with Checkatrade

Deciding how to boost SEO is a multi-billion pound industry, focused on improving websites against hundreds of different factors. It’s a complex process and often one where those with the biggest budgets get the best rewards. So how can you compete without spending a fortune?
Well, by  joining Checkatrade  we offer some great solutions to improve your rankings and gain new customers from search engines. Below, we’ve outlined how this is done as well as some top SEO advice for tradespeople and we take a look at what are the best local business SEO strategies.
What is SEO?
First, let’s take a step back for a moment and examine what SEO is. SEO stands for “search engine optimisation”. This term covers any activities done to help a website rank higher in search engines such as Google. This can include:
On page:
 Improving the content on your site and making sure it’s relevant for keywords you’d like to rank for. A key part of this is  keyword research .
Link building:
 Asking other sites to link to your website. This sends extra traffic and improves the authority of your site.
Technical SEO:
 Improving the way your site works. For example, you could make it more secure or load faster.
By covering these areas and working to improve them, you can attempt to boost the rankings of your website. Plus, you’ll also create content that’s relevant for users, and provide a better experience for visitors to your site, so there are additional benefits as well.
The below graphic shows some of the key areas:
What is local business SEO?
How can local businesses improve SEO? In addition to the above three areas, you can also deploy local SEO tactics to improve your rankings in a specific region of the UK. This helps reduce the area you’re focused on so you can find more locally relevant customers.
So, instead of trying to rank for “builder” which is highly competitive and will include many customers in regions you can’t serve, you would try and rank for “builder in Chichester” for example. This helps you reach a more targeted audience and is going to be easier to rank for. You’ll still be competing with other Chichester builders who also do local SEO, or have websites that rank well, and this is an area where Checkatrade can help – more on this later!
What is a local SEO strategy?
Some of the best local SEO tactics include:
Creating content that’s relevant to the local area.
Getting your company added to high quality directories, such as Checkatrade.
Ensuring your locations and contact details are mentioned on your website and elsewhere (also known as local SEO citations).
Getting local reviews.
You can learn more about SEO  via this resource from Moz .
Why is SEO important for tradespeople?
It’s never been easier to create a website and appear in search results, leading to a wealth of new businesses. But this increased competition also means it’s harder to stand out in a crowded market. After all, only one site can rank number one on Google for each term.
For this reason, SEO is important for tradespeople as it gives you the best possible chance to rank for the terms your prospective customers are searching for. It’s a myth that websites are automatically optimised for SEO. You have to put time and energy into SEO in order to get the best results.
That’s why people search for how to boost SEO. Because it’s an ongoing process and there’s always new content you could create, local SEO additions to make, or other ways you could optimise your site.
It’s worth noting that SEO for tradespeople, and any sector, is a long-term process. It takes time to make the improvements, for them to be accessed by search engines and for results to change.
This process is well worth it in the long run but if you need a quick solution, you could consider running paid adverts on search engines, which is also known as pay per click marketing. Our guide on  how Google and PPC works  is a great place to start.
How does Checkatrade boost SEO?
As we’ve established SEO for tradespeople is hard. It takes a lot of time and you’ll need a budget for SEO. If you don’t have the resources to do your own SEO, or funds to pay for an SEO agency, you could consider partnering with another site instead. But how can you leverage top sites to appear on Google search results?
One approach is  barnacle SEO . Much like how barnacles attach to bigger creatures and ships, you can place your brand on a larger site that does their own SEO. So instead of trying to rank for terms with your site, your aim is that the larger site will rank for the terms instead. It’s a fantastic solution for small businesses who don’t have the time or budget to compete.
One way you can do this is by  joining Checkatrade  and creating a profile. We have a highly skilled SEO team internally and work with other agencies to create hundreds of articles every month. As a result of this work, we currently rank for over 450,000 keywords* so reach customers in all sorts of regions and niches.
So, when people search for how to guides, cost guides, design inspiration, landlord advice, expert advice pieces and industry news, there’s a good chance they’ll see a piece of Checkatrade content. From those pieces they can search our database of tradespeople, helping our members to get more business thanks to our SEO efforts. It’s no wonder our team were shortlisted for the UK Content Award in 2021.
In addition to our content, we have category pages for different regions (e.g. plumber in Southampton). These pages help our members with local SEO, as we target regional terms and put Checkatrade members in the results when people are in need of help.
Lastly, all our member pages are optimised in line with SEO best practice, increasing the chance you’ll appear for the terms people are searching for. Sound good? Then why not  start your profile today ?

What are local SEO citations and the benefits of service reviews?
Local SEO citations are a key part of SEO for trades, as well as any good local SEO strategy. They include all of the times when another website mentions your contact details and company name. These citations help show you’re a real business and give you added authority.
Service reviews are also known as review snippets, a type of rich snippet. They are reviews of your services that can appear directly in the search results. These can be taken from your own site (with the right markup), your Checkatrade profile, or other sources. For more details read our  rich snippets guide .
Will you do SEO on my website?
Whilst we can help your business get known on search engines through our content and profile pages, we can’t do SEO on your website. We do however have details on excellent web designers in the UK that you can  browse here in our directory .
Will you replace my SEO agency?
No, we wouldn’t recommend you stop other existing SEO work even if you add a Checkatrade profile. It’s still important to optimise your own website where possible, especially if you already use an agency and are happy with them.
How can I learn more about SEO?
We highly recommend the  learn SEO guide from Moz  who’ve been helping people learn about SEO for over 15 years. Best of all, it’s absolutely free.
How can you leverage top sites to appear on Google search results?
With barnacle SEO, if you can get listed on another site that already ranks well you can appear when people are reading their content. By appearing on Checkatrade you’ll gain the benefit of our strong performing site, increasing the chance your Checkatrade listing will appear in search engines.
Useful checklist to boost your SEO with Checkatrade
To boost SEO, you need to improve your content, link building, and technical SEO.
Local SEO is an excellent way to improve your rankings locally.
By  joining Checkatrade  you get a well optimised profile page and the chance to receive new customers from our content.
We won’t replace your SEO agency but are a great low cost way for you to get more customers from search engines with Checkatrade acting as an intermediary.

Commercial vs domestic electricians,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/commercial-vs-domestic-electricians/,Tag Not Found,"Commercial vs domestic electricians

Electricians are known for installing and maintaining a wide range of different electrical systems. So, you might be wondering why there are both commercial and domestic sectors – surely, they are largely the same? While these two trades share a lot of similarities, there are also some distinctions to be aware of.
Different buildings demand different skills, so it’s important to understand where commercial and domestic electricians work best. You might be an experienced tradesperson looking to start your own business, new to the industry and looking for some tips, or even expanding your existing company to attract more customers. Either way, this article covers everything you need to know.
In a hurry and want some quick answers to the most common questions? Scroll down to the FAQs section below.
What is a domestic electrician?
Domestic electricians carry out electrical work mostly inside residential flats and houses. This can involve running cables, installing lighting, replacing fuse boxes and repairing electrical parts around the home.
Some rooms will have different requirements. For example, bathroom electrics won’t be set up in the same way as a kitchen – this means domestic electricians have the freedom to specialise in different areas of a home. Along with technical know-how, residential electricians will also be knowledgeable when it comes to complying with building regulations for domestic electrical systems.
With the rising popularity of electric cars in the UK, domestic electricians can now even install residential vehicle charging points as part of their service. For more information on this line of work, read our article  here .
Qualifications
Domestic electricians aren’t necessarily fully qualified. Those who aren’t in possession of the required qualifications are known as domestic electrical installers – these trades can carry out work on homes if they’re a member of the  Competent Persons Scheme . This includes a register of individuals that have demonstrated the skills and experience necessary to offer basic installation work.
Fully qualified domestic electricians will have undergone more thorough training and hold a Level 2 or Level 3 Diploma in Electrical Installation. It’s the most demanding career path in the sector and usually follows an apprenticeship or some form of long-term shadowed work.
Those who have completed the classroom and workshop levels will then need to be assessed at their place of work before taking the AM2 exam at a local test centre. You can read more about that  here .
What are commercial electricians?
Commercial electricians are professionals that complete electrical work for other businesses. This includes offices, schools, restaurants, shops and data centres. They may even extend their work to industrial environments such as factories, though this may require some engineering expertise. As with domestic jobs, commercial electricians have certain standards and regulations they must follow to make sure installations are safe and compliant.
Electrical work within commercial properties can include dealing with server rooms, backup generators, power supplies and industrial control panels. Other work may involve carrying out inspection reports, installing lighting and testing electrical appliances.
Qualifications
Commercial electricians have to be fully qualified. This means they will need to hold a Level 3 Diploma in Electrical Installation and another technical qualification. This can be either Level 3 NVQ Diploma in Electrotechnical Services or a Level 3 NVQ Diploma in Installing Electrotechnical Systems & Equipment.
Skilled tradespeople get your business started 
Join Checkatrade today  Join Now What is the difference between commercial and domestic electricians?
Domestic and commercial properties have different regulations, so electricians won’t necessarily have the same knowledge of building legislation and safety standards if they specialise in separate fields. For example, commercial electricians will have to follow  The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 .
Installations
There’s also a big difference between domestic and commercial electrical installation. Commercial electricians sometimes have to deal with high voltage power supplies, unlike residential electricians who are mainly dealing with 230 volts. Due to the high voltage in commercial settings, the wiring setup for electrical work is also different to what’s found in the home. Households require one power phase, while commercial buildings are supplied with a three-phase wiring design.
Services
The types of work that commercial and residential electricians carry out might sometimes overlap but there are key differences. While they may both install lighting, complete wiring and carry out electrical repairs, commercial electricians have to work on various systems and appliances you wouldn’t find in a home. Plus, these units and systems will need to be professionally tested, which isn’t always a requirement for residences.

Domestic electricians are likely to be hired for smaller jobs by individual homeowners, while commercial electricians could be contracted by companies for larger projects within their offices or shops. Whichever the case, these are both valuable sources of work for electricians and can make starting your own business a potentially lucrative opportunity. For more information on becoming a self-employed electrician, read our guide  here .
FAQs
What pays more commercial or residential electrician?
If you look at commercial vs domestic electrician salary, it seems that residential electrician work usually pays slightly more. On average, a commercial electrician earns £37,000 a year, while a domestic electrician earns about £37,500 per year. Of course, these are just averages and the amount you could make as a successful self-employed trade could be much higher.
What can domestic electricians do? 
This will depend on whether they are trained as a domestic electrical installer or a fully qualified domestic electrician. Installers can carry out:
Wiring in plumbing, heating and other appliances
Testing the safety of existing electrical installations
Testing the safety of new electrical installations
Testing the safety of portable appliances
Domestic electricians on the other hand can complete more major work, such as installing a home’s electrical system or repairing complex appliances.
Can a commercial electrician do domestic work?
Commercial electricians have the same diploma in electrical installation as domestic electricians, as well as further training on top of this. Seeing as they have more qualifications, they should be fully able to carry out domestic work if needed.
What is the difference between residential and commercial wiring?
Commercial buildings usually have more wires than residential properties and these come with added protection. Domestic wires only require plastic sheathing, while commercial applications are contained in conduits or ceiling rafters. The wiring setups also differ as commercial properties tend to need more electrical power than homes.

Does a new roof add value to a UK home?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/new-roof-add-value-uk-home/,Roof,"Does a new roof add value to a UK home?

In This Blog:
How does a new roof add value to a home?  How much does a new roof cost? Do I need a new roof? Whatever the reason for replacing your roof, you may be wondering if a new roof will add value to your home. The simple answer is, it won’t. However, it will make sure that you don’t lose value on your home.
A better way to look at the investment of a new roof is that it will stop you from losing money in any home valuation or sale, and it could save you huge repair costs later down the line.
Even though a new roof doesn’t necessarily ‘add value’ to your home, here’s why it’s still worth the investment.
How does a new roof add value to a home? 
A new roof can potentially add value for a number of reasons, mainly:
Structural reasons
Aesthetics
The resale market
Function of the house
Your roof is in the firing line, protecting your home from rain, wind, snow, and everything else in between. A damaged roof can lead to severe, and costly, problems within your home caused by rotten framing or roof leaks. A new roof will give you peace of mind that you’re safeguarding the structural integrity of your home.
A new roof can also add value to your home by increasing its energy efficiency. It will retain the heat better, which means less energy is needed to heat your home and therefore your energy bills will be less.
Improved appearance
A well-maintained roof can last around 20 years, but the signs of ageing may still be obvious on an older roof. A new roof will help to improve the overall appearance of your home and instantly update an older property.
If you’re building an extension, consider how the old will blend with the new. Many homeowners opt for a full roof replacement during an extension for a cohesive end result.
Home value
If you’re thinking of  putting your home on the market , a new roof can boost its sale value by increasing its curb appeal.
Prospective buyers will be encouraged to know the roof has been recently replaced, meaning they won’t need to budget for roof repairs or replacement for a while. This in turn means you’re more likely to get the full asking price for your property, a quicker sale, and smoother negotiations.

Find a roofer your neighbours recommend  How much does a new roof cost? The cost of a new roof will depend on a couple of different factors, including the design of the roof, the roof tiles used, the size of the roof, and where you live.
On average, a new roof will cost around 
£5,000 – £8,000
.
The cost to remove the existing roof before replacing it with new is around
 £1,000 – £2,500
.
There are a number of costs to budget for when planning your  roof installation  project:
Materials
To give you an idea of the cost of materials, a slate roof costs on average between 
£2,800 – £5,000
 on a standard house build.
Plain roofing tiles normally cost around 
£80 per m2
. Clay roof tiles come in at around 
£120 per m2
, while rubber roof installation is around 
£80 – £100 per m2
. Tin roof installation (for outbuildings such as garden sheds, garages, or workspaces) costs around 
£50 – £65 per m2
.
For more information on the various types of roofing material, read our post on  roof replacement cost .
Labour
A roofer’s day rate is normally between 
£150 – £250
.
Your roofer will quote for the cost of removing the existing roof and installing the new one.
Additional costs
Aside from labour and materials, you may also need to factor in the cost of: Scaffolding Skip hire Structural works, e.g. trusses, rafters, battens, and joists
Ply
Insulation
Waterproof membrane and felt
Soffits and fascias
Rainwater gutters and downpipes
Leadwork
To get an accurate quote for the cost of a new roof, use our  request a quote  feature to get at least three quotes from local roofing experts in your area. Do I need a new roof? The warning signs that suggest you might need a new roof include:
Damaged tiles
They could be cracked, rotten, buckled, torn, missing, worn, curled or loose.
Misshapen, sunken or missing tiles
This could be due to structural sagging, which is a serious concern. Contact a  local roofer  who can investigate this safely for you. They can also check whether the underlay is damaged or rotten.
Water damage or mould
If you’ve noticed water stains or mould on your interior walls or the ceiling, it’s likely to be due to a leak. If you’re able to, check the loft to find out where the water is entering your property.
Streaks of light coming into the loft
You should not be able to see daylight through your roof (unless looking through a Velux!). If you can see streaks of light coming through the roof, contact a roofing specialist asap.
Worn chimney flashing
Roof flashing is the grey material between the tiles and a hard structure, such as the chimney stack or roof vents. Its purpose is to maintain a watertight roof. If roof flashing becomes loose or worn over time, water will penetrate through the roof and into your home.
If your roof is more than 20 years old, or you notice any of the warning signs listed above, it might be time for a new roof. Not only will this give you peace of mind as to the structural integrity of your property, and the roof’s ability to keep the elements out, it will also add value to your home.
Roofing is a specialist skill and involves working at height, therefore this work should always be carried out by a qualified roofer.

How to install a handrail in 6 easy steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/install-handrail/,Tag Not Found,"How to install a handrail in 6 easy steps

In This Blog: How to install a handrail How to install a handrail on your stairway FAQs Are you looking to install a handrail but not sure where to begin? Our how to install a handrail guide has everything you need to know about installation and the required building regulations.
Most stairways with two or more steps need to be equipped with a safety measurement in the form of a handrail or guardrail, which gives people ascending and descending the stairs extra security.
These regulations tend to apply to both indoor and outdoor stairways:
If stairs are more than 1m wide, they need to include a handrail on at least one side.
The height of the handrail needs to be between 90cm and 100cm from the top of the rail to the pitch (rake) line.
The handrails need to be fashioned so a person can grip them tightly if need be.
A handrail can’t have any protrusions on either end that pose a safety risk.
The handrail should be able to withstand a weight of around 200lbs when applied in a downward or outward direction. The ability to support that weight needs to be maintained within 2 inches of the top edge of the rail.
Don’t forget to check out our blog about  handrail installation cost  and  glass stair railing cost  for information about pricing up your project.

Find neighbours know and trust  How to install a handrail There are various types of handrails on the market to match your style and tastes. You may think that installing these necessities is an easy job; however, due to the safety requirements, it can be a bigger job than it seems.
For example, you need to place sturdy brackets to studs or posts to anchor the handrail, and they need to line up with the tread of your stairs. As a result, careful measurements will be required to make sure it’s in the right position.
The easiest way to meet your building requirements and install a handrail is to buy a pre-built handrail bar, cut it to length, and attach it to the wall studs with sturdy brackets. Although this option is quick and inexpensive, it’s not always the most attractive finish.
For guaranteed style and safety, why not hire one of our  handrail installation experts ? When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews.
If you’re still looking to install a handrail yourself, read on for the tools you’ll need and the steps you need to follow.
Tools you’ll need for the job
Stud finder
Pencil
Tape measure
Masking tape (optional)
Spirit level
Mitre saw
Drill and bits
Screwdriver
Pretreated handrail
Handrail brackets
1/2-inch stainless steel wood screws

Find neighbours know and trust  How to install a handrail on your stairway Whether you’re looking for how to install a handrail on a wall,  how to install a handrail on a deck , or how to install a basement stair handrail, these instructions have you covered.
Step one: Find and mark the studs
Take your stud finder and turn it on. Following the user manual’s instructions, locate the studs on your stairway to find the best locations for the brackets and mark with a pencil. You want to make sure your brackets are no less than four feet apart. Any more than this risks an unsteady finish. Place the brackets about 30cm from the top and bottom of the handrail, and include one in the centre.
Once you’ve marked the locations, use your spirit level to mark vertical lines that let you know where the centre of each stud needs to go. If you don’t want to mark your wall, use some masking tape.
Note:
With open or exposed stairways that have balusters, the brackets might need to go on the newel posts instead of the wall studs.
Step two: Cut the handrail to the right length
Now you’ve completed your measurements and marking, it’s time to measure and cut your handrail to the right length. To make it easy to grip, extend the handrail beyond the top and bottom steps. Keep it an equal distance to the width of a stair tread.
Top tip:
Use a mitre saw to cut each end of the handrail to make a vertical edge perpendicular to the floor.
Step three: Mark out the height of the handrail
Take your tape measure and spirit level and mark the wall your handrail is being attached about 36 inches from the nose of the stair treads, including the top, bottom, and middle of the handrail’s location. This creates reference marks that reveal the location of the top edge of the handrail. To ensure the right height, these vertical marks are the most important to get right. The regulations ask that the height of the rail remains between 90cm and 100cm from the top of the rail to the pitch (rake) line.
Step four: Mark out where the brackets are going to go
You might need to ask someone to help you with this step as it requires you to hold the handrail against the wall, making sure the top edge matches the reference marks you drew. This lets you draw the bottom reference marks on the handrail (the point where the handrail intersects the lines marking the studs) and show you where the top of the support brackets need to go.
Step five:  Secure the brackets to the wall
Now you know where to position the brackets, use your reference marks to attach them to the wall using your screwdriver and screws. Make sure the tops of the brackets are flush with the bottom edge of the handrail.
Step six: Attach the handrail to the brackets
Once your brackets are in position, attach your handrail on top of them, leaving enough overhang at the top and bottom. To secure the handrail, use the support brackets that have U-shaped sleeves around the arms and use your drill to tightly screw them in. It’s worth drilling pilot holes if you have wooden handrails.
Voila! You’ve just secured your handrail.

Find neighbours know and trust  FAQs Should I hire a professional?
For the best results, we recommend hiring a  handrail installation expert . This will ensure that your handrail is secure and sturdy and meets building regulations.
When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews. Even better, those reviews are from your neighbours and checked by us to make sure they’re legitimate.
How can I install a handrail and balusters?
Installing balusters as well as a handrail is a  job for a professional . Balusters are a trickier installation due to their fiddly nature. As a result, getting a perfect finish isn’t as easy as it seems. However, if you do want to attempt adding them yourself, make sure you space them no more than 4 inches apart. They also need to be able to withstand 50 pounds of pressure. Take a look at our  banister and spindle costs .
What height should a handrail be?
Handrails need to be between 90 and 100cm from the pitch line (the invisible line that runs from the lip of a stair to another one) to the top of the rail.
Where should a handrail start and end?
Handrails need to follow the pitch line from the bottom of the stairs to the top.

What size bath do I need for my project?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/what-size-bath/,Tag Not Found,"What size bath do I need for my project?

Choosing a bath is often one of the most important considerations when having a new bathroom fitted. Often the largest fixture in a bathroom, the rest of the space will usually be designed around the bath itself. This means you’ll need to work closely with your customers, helping to properly measure the space and explain the different options available.
Your role is to guide the consumer into picking the best bath to fit the space. So, whilst on a job you may be wondering “what size bath do I need?” Don’t worry, this guide is designed to cover everything you need to know about deciding on a bath. Today we’ll be looking into different bath sizes, how to pick the perfect bath, how to correctly measure bathtub size, and answering your FAQs.
What size bath do I need?
Before you advise your customer on what size bath to purchase, it’s worth explaining the different types of bath available. Each bath style will be shaped differently and take up differing amounts of space. The options include:
Corner baths
Straight baths
P shaped baths
L shaped baths
Free standing baths
Whirlpool baths
It’s also worth considering that different consumers use baths in different ways. Ask your customer what they’ll be primarily using the bath for. For example, if the bath will be used for bathing children and dogs, a good size straight bath should be fine. However, if relaxation is the main use, it may be worth choosing a whirlpool or freestanding bath.
What size bath should I get?
Once you’ve discussed your customer’s needs, you’ll want to know ‘what size bath should I get?’. Firstly, think about how tall your customer is. Someone over 6 foot will need a longer bath to allow them to fully relax, while a bath that’ll only be used to bathe a child won’t need to be very long.
Next, look at the size of the bathroom. If the space is very small, you won’t want to obstruct access to other parts of the room. What’s more, if there’s already a bath in place, your customer may simply want a like for like replacement so you’ll need to take a little time to properly measure the old tub.
Buying bathroom tools and materials
When you’ve come to a decision about the right bath for your customer, you’ll need to buy the bath itself.  Joining Checkatrade  means not only will you be a valued member of the UK’s leading trade directory, but you’ll also receive great discounts on business essentials like tools and materials as part of our Buyers Club.
How to measure bathtub size
It’s incredibly important to be careful when measuring for a bath as ordering the wrong size will mean unhappy customers and wasted time for you. We’d always recommend measuring twice to be completely sure your readings are accurate.
Use the following steps to measure bathtub size:
Length
: Usually the distance from one wall to the next or if the bath is a direct replacement, measure the length of the old bath.
Width
: Take the distance from one side of the bath to the other. If you’re adding a differently sized bath, measure across the space where you want the bath to sit.
Height:
 Take a measurement from the ground to the height you want the bath to reach.
Freestanding
: If the bath will be freestanding, you should take measurements from the widest parts of the bath. This will usually be the top edges.
Taps
: Always make sure to leave enough space for any taps
Obstructions
: Check that the bath won’t obstruct access to other parts of the bathroom or the door.
If you have any concerns about measuring for oddly sized baths or the right methods to use, why not become a  Checkatrade member . You’ll have access to our members community, an online space where you can chat with other tradespeople, getting advice and support. Plus, Checkatrade generates twice as many jobs as other platforms*, helping to grow your business.

What are the standard UK bath sizes?
Most baths will come in standard sizes, this makes it easier for manufacturers to size their new baths. Generally, the standard UK bath size is 1700mm by 700mm, while a large bath is 1800mm by 800mm and a small bath is 1400mm by 700mm.
What is the average bath capacity in litres?
Every bath will have a different capacity for water, depending on its width, length, and height. But the average bath capacity is 100 litres.
How big should a bath be?
This will mainly depend on the size of the bathroom, who’ll be using the bath and what its purpose will be. For example, a bath used for relaxation by a tall customer will work best if it’s a larger size like 1800mm by 800mm.
What should be the minimum size of a bath?
If your customer’s bathroom is very small, then they’ll likely want to add a more compact bathtub. The minimum size bath that’s widely available will be 1400mm by 700mm.
Is a 1500mm freestanding bath too small?
This will depend on your customer’s height and how they plan to use the bath. A tall person may find this length of bath uncomfortable but for bathing a child it’ll work perfectly.
What is a good size for a soaking tub?
Soaking tubs are designed for comfort and relaxation above all else and a longer, deeper tub is recommended for a more immersive experience. In fact, soaking tubs can be found on the market ranging from 1500mm long to 2200mm long.
What is the most popular size for a bathtub?
The most popular size of bathtub today is 1700mm by 700mm.
Useful checklist for determining what size bath you need
Choosing a bath is an essential part of planning a new bathroom and the right bath for your customer will depend on its intended use and who’ll be using it.
Baths often come in a standard size of 1700mm by 700mm but are available in a range of other options.
There are a wide variety of bath types, ranging from standard straight baths to whirlpool and corner baths.
We have a range of different membership options to choose from and as a  Checkatrade member  you can proudly display the Checkatrade logo. This helps to show consumers you are committed to offering excellent service and your business is credible and trustworthy.

Best jobs to retrain for at 50,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/best-jobs-to-retrain-for-at-50/,Tag Not Found,"Best jobs to retrain for at 50

Starting a new career at any age can be daunting, not least at 50 when other colleagues might be considering retirement after full-time employment. But heading down a different path at this age isn’t as overwhelming or difficult as many are led to believe.
If you’re looking for a new challenge, or interested in trying something new, you may want to consider retraining as a tradesperson. It’s never too late and can be a hugely rewarding experience, especially if you’ve come from a sector that doesn’t offer much job satisfaction. Every day is different for trades and if you go self-employed, you’ll be able to choose your own hours and the types customers you work for.
Whether you’ve got some earlier trade experience or just looking to learn on the way, this guide is for you. We’ve put together a list of the best jobs to retrain for at 50 and included an overview of benefits and qualifications needed to help you decide.
Career change at 50 ideas
While there is no consensus for what the ‘best’ career path is for someone in their 50s, retraining as a tradesperson is definitely one of the smarter choices.
There are countless opportunities for qualified tradespeople in the UK right now. The government, for example, is pushing for more new build housing, so the country will need a lot more workers capable of building new properties and providing water and electricity for them in the coming years. This boom will of course run alongside all the usual maintenance, renovation and upgrade work that takes place each day.
Trade professions are a popular choice for people at this age, especially those that have come from a desk-based job. You’re on the move most days, mainly working with your hands and can quickly progress once qualified. Being older, you will also have gained knowledge that employers really value. But this equally applies to those interested in setting up their own business.
With courses available and life experience valued, there’s plenty of opportunities out there for you to consider. The following list is by no means complete and gives an overview of some of the best options. Ultimately your decision will be based on personal circumstances and the experience you have gained to date.
Building surveying
Those who have worked in an engineering field will feel at home moving into building surveying, but even those with no experience will enjoy this job. Tradespeople in this field inspect all visible and accessible parts of a building, including roofs, walls, floors, windows and doors, chimneys, garages, basements and outbuildings. They will give clients advice on the structural integrity of a build and will make suggestions for improvements where needed.
Benefits
The work is not desk bound so you’ll be on site and not tied to your screen
This role is very varied and no two days are the same
Graduate building surveyors can expect to earn around £22,000-£26,000. With a few years’ experience you’ll earn in the region of £28,000-£50,000 and at senior level this can rise to £70,000 or more
Experience or qualifications needed for building surveying  
The quickest way to become a building surveyor is to study for a building surveying undergraduate degree that’s been approved by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and/or the Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB). This takes three years full time
You can also move into this field by studying for a building surveying postgraduate ‘conversion course’. This also needs to be approved by RICS and/or the CIOB and can last either nine months or a year full time, depending on the type of qualification.
There are a few building surveying apprenticeships available and many of these apprenticeships are organised through the Chartered Surveyors’ Training Trust
You’ll typically work towards a professional qualification known as chartership awarded by RICS – you can read more about that  here .
If you’re looking for an entry-level job instead, you could apply for a building surveying technician job with a higher national diploma (HND)
Carpenters
Carpentry is one of the world’s oldest trades and incredibly fulfilling. Since carpenters are always in demand, you’ll have no problem finding plenty of paid work once you’re qualified. It’s also an excellent trade for starting up your own business – read more about that  here .
Benefits
Easily start your own business and be your own boss
More flexible working hours
Increased earning potential – £31,600 national average UK salary
Satisfying career that you truly enjoy – see your designs come to life
Great personal and professional development opportunities
Experience or qualifications needed for carpentry  
There are fast-track training courses that allow you to learn the skills and gain the essential qualifications required of a carpenter in a few weeks, allowing you to bypass the traditional college course route
You’ll need to be good with your hands and comfortable using different tools
Some up-front costs will be needed for machinery, tools and a workshop space
Skilled tradespeople get your business started 
Join Checkatrade today  Join Now Electricians
Electricians are some of the highest-earning tradespeople so if you’d like a career that requires no degree and is easy on the physical labour side of things, look no further.
Benefits
A fantastic salary of approximately £32,000 a year, rising with experience
Flexibility – with the current skills shortage, it’s possible to find work as an electrician virtually anywhere in the UK
Be your own boss – qualified electricians can pick the jobs that suit them, with this freedom allowing you to pick your schedule
Great trade for starting up your own firm – get started with that  here .
Experience or qualifications needed for electricians  
Training as an electrician once took up to three years as it required studying in college and undertaking an apprenticeship in order to qualify. But now there are courses available that are designed to get you qualified in as little as six months!
Once you’ve been trained online and got some experience, you’ll do a final assessment. If you pass, you’ll be able to legally trade as an electrician and work on a wide range of projects
Plumbers
Getting into plumbing is easier than in many other lines of work and is a common profession to retrain for at 50 – the potential earnings are a big reason why. Like electricians, this trade is always in demand and there’s the opportunity to work on some impressive projects. Again, this is another excellent industry to set up your own business and reap the rewards of self-employment. Head over to our handy guide about that by clicking  here .
Benefits
The average salary for a plumber in the UK is £16.51 per hour, but self-employment can see this rise by a lot more
Great opportunities to start a new business
If you retrain as an adult, you’ll likely earn more than average in your first role – you could also take home extra by  becoming registered to work with gas Job freedom and variety
Experience or qualifications needed for plumbers 
Your two main entry routes are to become a plumber’s mate or complete a fast-track plumbing course. It’s best to retrain through a course if you want to increase your earning potential and land a job quickly.
Gas engineers
Gas engineering is a highly rewarding profession with excellent career prospects. Working with gas requires some training beforehand, but once passed you’ll be an approved engineer in high demand.
Plumbers often retrain as gas engineers in their 50s due to the increased salary and ability to attract a wider client base. But even if you have no prior trade experience, it’s still a great option for those interested in a challenge. For a complete overview of the Gas Safe register and how to start your own gas engineering business – click  here .
Benefits
Excellent salary, often more than £40,000 per year
High demand in all parts of the UK
Ability to start up your own firm
Stable market and easy route to self-employment
Experience or qualifications needed for gas engineering 
You’ll first need to take a  gas engineering course  and become Gas-Safe registered – this involves training for assessments which can take as little as 25 weeks with experienced training providers
Jobs for 50-year-olds with no experience
Trade businesses offer something very different and exciting for those who have spent several years in the same career. With demand so high for trained professionals, many of the requirements are now being relaxed to get more people into work. This is
a great opportunity for people who have little or no experience in a trade-related field.
The same can be said for those that do have experience under their belt but are considering learning a new trade. While this may sound daunting at first, you’ll soon realise that many of the skills you’ve learned in another job will apply in your new career – especially if you’re keen on setting up your own business at some point.
Job training programs for over 50s
There are many training academies that offer accredited training courses for different trades. Some will get you qualified in a short space of time, while others may need more of your time to get passed. Either way, there’s no shortage of options and it’s very likely there’s something nearby, so you won’t have to travel too far. You can explore the available options through the National Careers Service which offers apprenticeships or a skills health check to help you plan your next career path.
FAQs
What is the best career to start at 50?
There isn’t a single answer to this question, as it will depend on what you enjoy, how much you want to earn and if you’re willing to study again. That said, retraining for a new role in your 50s is becoming very common, so don’t feel discouraged by being a latecomer to a new trade.
What new jobs can I do at 50?
The sky’s the limit! But just make sure you’re happy with the physical demands of some trades. Plumbing, for example, is harder on the body than building surveying, so keep that in mind when choosing a new direction.
What is a good second career for someone over 50?
Finding the ‘right’ career is never easy but trades offer a good balance of earning potential and variety. Transferable skills and life experience will also set you up for success if you’re keen on running your own company.
Is 50 too old to start a new career?
Never. There are loads of options, even for people with little experience, and age shouldn’t be a factor. As long as you’re keen and physically able to complete the work, you’ll find great success in your new career.

What to do if you have hard water,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/hard-water/,"Bathroom, Kitchen","What to do if you have hard water

In This Blog: Signs of hard water How hard is my water? How to soften hard water How to remove hard water stains FAQs Hard water can cause a variety of costly and frustrating problems within the home. Read on to find out what the signs of hard water are and what to do if you have hard water. Signs of hard water Some tell-tale signs of hard water include:
Limescale deposits and damage to appliances, such as the kettle and washing machine
Water stains or ‘scale’ on surfaces such as the shower screen, taps, and glassware
Blocked pipes and boilers, which can manifest as low water pressure (and potentially a broken boiler)
Worsening skin complaints, such as eczema
If this sounds familiar, read on to learn how to determine how hard your water is, how to soften hard water, and how to remove those unsightly water stains. How hard is my water? More than 13 million households in the UK are affected by hard water.
Determining how hard your water is is largely down to where you live. The South East of England and London water hardness levels are predominantly high. Generally, Scotland, Ireland and Wales have soft water. Hard water is measured in parts per million (PPM).  The volume of particles of hardness dissolved in the water per million particles gives a rating of water hardness.
0 – 50 PPM is considered soft water
101 – 150 PPM is slightly hard water
201 – 275 PPM is hard water
A rating of 350+ PPM would be classed as aggressively hard water
To find out the water hardness where you live, use the postcode checker facility on your local water provider’s website.

Find a water softener installer near you  How to soften hard water Hard water can often do the most damage to hot water appliances, for example, your boiler, kettle, or washing machine. When hard water is heated, it leaves behind the minerals responsible for hard water – calcium and magnesium – which solidify into scale.
Over time, the build-up of scale can narrow the pathway inside your pipes, reducing the flow of water. This can result in low water pressure. Scale can also build up on the outside of water fixtures, such as taps and the showerhead, causing a reduced water flow.
So how do you soften hard water to avoid all of this?
The best way to make hard water soft is to install a water softener. A water softener is a filtering system that removes calcium and magnesium minerals from your water. With a water softener you’ll:
Prolong the lifespan of pipes and home appliances.
Enjoy healthier skin and hair (especially important if you suffer from eczema or a dry scalp).
Reduce the number of cleaning products you use as you won’t be battling the build-up of scale.
Use less detergent in your laundry, and your washing will feel softer and cleaner.
Save money.
A water softener installer will visit your home to conduct a survey. Based on this, they will be able to recommend the right water softening system to suit your needs.
Cost of installing a water softener
A water softener will typically cost between 
£400 – £630
. However, there are many different types of water softener, and you can pay up to 
£2,000
 if you opt for top-of-the-range. While the cost can seem high, a water softening system is an investment to help avoid the costly repair or replacement of damaged appliances due to hard water.
To have a water softener installed will cost on average 
£225
. The other option is to rent a water softener. The cost for this is around 
£22 per month
, which includes the cost of installation. Either way, you will need to budget for water softener salt (around

Mix equal parts white vinegar and fresh water in a spray bottle and use it as you would a general bathroom cleaner. This solution can be applied to sinks, taps, shower screens, baths and tiles. Rinse thoroughly with plain water afterwards and buff with a microfibre cloth.
To tackle hard water stains on a showerhead, remove the showerhead and soak it overnight in a solution of equal parts white vinegar and fresh water. Carefully use a needle to gently poke any remaining scale out of the jet holes.
To remove scale from the inside of your kettle, fill the kettle with a solution of half water and half white vinegar and leave overnight. Rinse thoroughly the next morning to make sure you remove any vinegary odours.
To freshen up and remove scale from your dishwasher, fill a cup with white vinegar and place it on the top rack of the machine. Run the dishwasher on its hottest setting.
To reduce scale build-up in your washing machine, add a large cup of white vinegar or lemon juice in place of detergent and run the machine empty on a normal cycle.

Find a water softener installer near you  FAQs What is hard water?
Hard water is water that contains an excess of calcium and magnesium minerals. The concentration of which depends on where you live.
What makes water hard?
Water is naturally soft when it falls from the sky. What makes it ‘hard’ is the ground it comes into contact with. Therefore, if rainwater lands on an area of porous rock, e.g. limestone, it passes through the rock and picks up dissolved particles and minerals such as calcium and magnesium, resulting in hard water.
What is the difference between hard water and soft water?
The hardness or softness of water is determined by the volume of dissolved minerals calcium and magnesium. The addition of these minerals in hard water changes its structure, which results in scale deposits on household appliances and pipes.

Are solar panels worth it?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/are-solar-panels-worth-it/,Roof,"Are solar panels worth it?

In This Blog: What’s the benefit of having solar panels? Is my house right for solar panels? How much does solar panel installation cost? Earning money from your solar panels Maintenance costs of solar panels in the UK Always consult a solar panel installation expert FAQs Solar panels are a great way to reduce your home’s carbon footprint and power your home and can prove to be a worthwhile investment in the right circumstances. However, installing solar panels on your property is a big decision, so it’s important to do your research before jumping into it. We’ve put together this expert guide to help you find out if solar panels are worth it for you, your home and your pocket. What’s the benefit of having solar panels? The main benefit of switching to solar is how much money you can save on your energy bills. The average UK home uses 
3,760 kWh of electricity per year
 and the average UK domestic solar panel system generates between 
2,400 and 3,200 kWh per year
. Based on this, you could save between 63% – 85% on your annual electricity bills by installing solar panels on your roof.
As well as the financial savings, there’s also the carbon footprint reduction. Generating 3,000 kWh of electricity through solar panels instead of a gas-fired power station will save around a tonne of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.
Plus, by creating your own power supply, you’re also not at the mercy of power cuts and price rises. Is my house right for solar panels? There are three main factors to consider here, roof size, roof direction and roof integrity.
Is your roof big enough for solar panels?
Based on average UK weather, you’ll want to install a minimum of 3 kilowatts of solar panels on your roof. Taking the average size of a solar panel, this equates to an area of 20m2.
You can work out the rough roof size of your roof by measuring the length and width in metres of your building where it meets the ground. Then multiply the two numbers to give you your total roof area in m2. But remember that you’ll probably only be installing panels on one side, so halve the number for a more accurate figure.
The direction your house faces matters
As you’d expect, a south-facing roof is best for harvesting sunlight. If your solar panels are south-facing, you can expect to generate around 20% more electricity than if they were east- or west-facing.
Roof integrity is key
Although relatively light, it’s crucial to make sure your roof can safely take the weight of solar panels. For this reason, it’s essential to get a solar panel installation expert to come and assess your roof as a first step in your project.
Simply enter your postcode in the free search tool below to find local solar panel specialists recommended by your neighbours.

Find solar panel installers recommended by your neighbours  How much does solar panel installation cost? The cost of your solar panel installation will depend on a number of factors, including:
The type of panels you want
The amount of energy you want to generate
The size and type of your property
The direction in which your roof faces
The quality of components you require
Whether you want a battery or not
On average, you should expect to pay between 
£5,000 – £8,000 
for the supply and installation of a Photovoltaic (PV) solar panel system and between 
£4,000 – £5,000
 for a thermal solar panel system. Take a look at our guide on the  cost of solar panel installation  for more information and to find out about the different types of solar panels available. Earning money from your solar panels Solar panels can generate more power than is needed in a home, which means you could have spare electricity. As most solar panel installations don’t include a battery, this electricity is sent to the national grid to be used by other properties.
The  Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) scheme , launched in January 2020 in England, Scotland and Wales, means you’re paid for any surplus electricity you contribute to the grid. The amount you’re paid depends on the tariff set by your energy supplier, so to find out it’s best to contact them.
Top tip:
 When your solar panels are installed, it may be worth switching suppliers to find the best SEG scheme tariff. Maintenance costs of solar panels in the UK Lifetime maintenance costs on solar panels are relatively low, here’s a breakdown:
Service:
 You should set aside between 
£100 – £200 a year
 for an  annual service  by a solar panel specialist.
Cleaning:
 To keep your system efficient you should get your panels cleaned by an expert very six months, which chould cost between 
£4 – £15 per panel
. You can find out more in our  solar panel cleaning cost  guide.
Inverter: 
With an average lifespan of around 25 years, your inverter will last a long time before needing replacing. When it does, expect to pay between 
£800 – £1,000.
You can find a more detailed breakdown of costs to consider in our  solar panel maintenance cost  guide. Always consult a solar panel installation expert Hopefully, you now have an understanding of the costs involved in installing solar panels and a clearer idea of whether solar panels are worth it for your property. It goes without saying that the installation of solar panels should only be completed by a professional, as it’s a complex process and the health and financial risks if it goes wrong are significant.
Thankfully, it’s easy to get quotes and advice from trusted local solar panel experts that are recommended by your neighbours. Simply enter your postcode in the free search tool below to get started.

Find solar panel installers recommended by your neighbours  FAQs Will solar panels affect the value of my home?
The general view on this is no. Most estate agents will tell you solar panels make no positive or negative difference to the value of your property. Any uplift you did see, if, for example, your buyer was particularly sustainability-minded, would unlikely be greater than the cost of installation.
What will be the payback time on my solar panels?
Based on figures from the  Energy Saving Trust , it can take between 11- 27 years to see the cost of your installation repaid to you in savings and surplus electricity payments.
Your exact payback period will depend on your location in the UK, the direction your panels face and how much electricity you use. An expert will be able to provide an accurate cost-benefit analysis of solar panels based on your situation.
Can I get free solar panels?
While free solar panels were offered by companies in the past, there’s no way to get free solar panels in 2021. Although the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) scheme does mean you’re paid for any surplus electricity you generate, meaning you can offset your overall cost of installation.
Do I need planning permission for solar panels?
In the UK, the installation of solar panels on a house roof is classed as  permitted development , and as such you usually won’t need planning permission. You will still need building regulations sign off though, particularly as they will be positioned on your property’s roof structure.

Using recycled building materials,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/using-recycled-building-materials/,Tag Not Found,"Using recycled building materials

In This Blog: What are reclaimed building materials? What are the benefits of recycled building materials? Tips for recycling and the reuse of building materials How to recycle home building materials Is my project right for reclaimed building materials? How much do used building materials cost? Where to find reclaimed building materials What are the best ways to save money when building a house? FAQs The idea of building using recycled materials may seem strange, but there are lots of benefits in doing so. Reclaimed building materials can have a lower cost than new materials, plus they’re an environmentally friendly option for sustainable home construction. Find out everything you need to know about using used building materials for your construction project. What are reclaimed building materials? Used, recycled or reclaimed building materials are essentially bricks, tiles, wood and other materials that have already been part of a building. Typically, these come from a property that has been demolished, and the reusable materials have been salvaged by the demolition company to be sold on. What are the benefits of recycled building materials? The main benefits of going for used building materials over brand new are cost, sustainability and uniqueness.
Cost:
 In some cases, recycled building materials are cheaper than buying new ones, which can significantly reduce the overall cost of your construction project.
Sustainable:
 Used materials can be classed as environmentally friendly building materials because no new carbon emissions or chemical bi-products have been produced in their manufacture. They already existed, and at the very most the only carbon footprint is related to their delivery and use.
Uniqueness: 
Unlike mass-produced materials, recycled building materials can be one-offs or no longer produced, which brings a unique element to the design and finish of your property.

Find your local builder today  Tips for recycling and the reuse of building materials If you want to give the environment a helping hand, recycling and the reuse of building materials is the way to go. Rather than being old and damaged, recycled materials have stood the test of time and are a natural way of enhancing the structure and appearance of your property.
Recycled materials can often be found at reclamation yards and may include:
Plastic
Masonry
Timber
Steel and other metals
Concrete
Wiring
Insulation
Plumbing fixtures How to recycle home building materials Some of the most common uses for recycled materials are listed below but there are also other ways these materials can be used:
Metal:
 Once metal is melted down it can be transformed into the perfect shape and size materials for your project.
Concrete: 
Can be used in driveways, paths, and patios as a solid foundation.
Timber:
 Can be used for flooring, decoration, and outside decking. Is my project right for reclaimed building materials? The challenge with reclaimed building materials is supply and volume. As you’d expect, the unique nature of used bricks, for example, is that there will only be as many as were removed from another site. This means there may not be enough if you’re planning on using them to build an entire home.
The best thing to do is locate the right amount of reclaimed materials you need for your entire project before committing to a particular style. This way you know you’ll have enough alternative building materials to finish the job. It’s always worth speaking to your local builder to find out
Using recycled building materials on an extension
Used building materials are particularly ideal for extension projects. This is because your home’s existing bricks may not be manufactured anymore, so by using reclaimed bricks you may be able to find the same ones of ones similar to match the rest of your property.
Used materials are also ideal for an extension because of ageing. Even if you can still buy the bricks that were used to build your house, new ones will look different to your existing ones as they will be brand new, not aged. By using reclaimed building materials from a similar aged property, you can match the look ensuring your extension looks like it has always been part of your property. How much do used building materials cost? Due to the wide range of reclaimed building materials available, costs can vary greatly. Here’s a breakdown of the average costs of the most commonly used building materials:
Recycled bricks:
 You can expect to pay on average between 
35p – £2.00 per reclaimed brick
 plus VAT.
Recycled tiles: 
Tiles come in many materials, shapes and sizes, but typically you’ll pay between 
40p – £1.20 per tile
 plus VAT, depending on its rarity, condition and craftsmanship.
Recycled doors: 
Again, there are so many designs and types when it comes to reclaimed doors, but expect to pay from 
£120
 plus VAT for a period wooden internal door, up to 
£1,000 or more
 plus VAT for a traditional glazed front door.
Recycled flooring:
 If you’re wanting to use reclaimed floorboards or parquet on your project, then you should set aside on average between 
£25 per m2 – £55 per m2
.
For practical suggestions on how to cut the cost of your construction project, check out our guide on  how to save money when building a house . Where to find reclaimed building materials Reclamation yards are always a good bet, as well as demolition companies, but be sure to call ahead with both of these as they’re not always open to the public.
Auction houses are also a good source of reclaimed building materials, particularly with items like chimney pots or garden ornaments to top walls. Beyond this, try online auction sites, but be aware that unless the seller is local, getting hold of your recycled building materials can be difficult and expensive.
Another way is to speak to your local builder. They may have some sustainable building materials that they can use for your project or are able to source for you. Simply enter your postcode below to find builders recommended by your neighbours. What are the best ways to save money when building a house? Building your own home is a dream for many people but there’s no denying it can be an expensive process. To help you stick to your budget, we’ve put together a guide on  saving money when building a house . Read our top tips for cutting costs including shopping around and keeping things simple.

Find your local builder today  FAQs What is a reclamation yard?
Reclamation yards are scattered throughout the UK and are great places to find recycled building materials. Unwanted materials and other items are brought to reclamation yards to be reused or resold. You may find anything from wood to concrete and metal at a reclamation yard. You can also find other items like doors and flooring. What are reclaimed building materials? The term reclaimed building materials refers to materials that have been previously used in construction and are now suitable for reuse. Choosing these materials is a great way of owning a piece of history and saving on the cost of new materials. You may find reclaimed wood, reclaimed bricks and reclaimed timber in your search.
Is building using recycled materials safe?
It’s always recommended that you buy reclaimed building materials from a specialist supplier, this way you can be sure of the quality and safety of the product. You should expect to see weathering and some damage on bricks, tiles and doors etc, but remember these materials would’ve probably lasted another 100 years in the building they were originally part of.
Are used building materials easy to use when building?
Apart from existing holes in tiles bricks and doors, or wear on floorboards, there are few complications to using reclaimed building materials. Just be aware that sizes may not be standard, but that just adds to the unique look!
Do I get the same quality guarantee with used building materials?
It’s unlikely a reclaimed building materials supplier, reclamation yard or auction house will give you the same guarantee as a modern manufacturer who is producing and testing their products en masse. That said, they may offer a limited warranty, so it’s always good to ask before buying.

Landlord garden responsibilities explained,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/landlord-garden-responsibilities/,Garden,"Landlord garden responsibilities explained

In This Blog: What are a landlord’s garden responsibilities? What is covered by landlord garden maintenance?  Disputing landlord or tenant garden maintenance FAQs Understanding landlord garden responsibilities, and outlining this with tenants from the offset, will help to avoid any unnecessary disputes further down the line.
For this reason, the expectations for landlord garden maintenance are usually set out in the tenancy agreement. What are a landlord’s garden responsibilities? In general, a landlord is responsible for making necessary repairs to the rental property, and a tenant is responsible for maintaining it. The garden is no different.
Landlord garden responsibilities will normally require the landlord to maintain the areas of the garden that would be unreasonable for the tenant to do themselves. For example, performing tasks that require specialist skills, such as  tree trimming .
Gardening jobs typically classed as the landlord’s responsibility include: 
Hedge trimming
Tree maintenance
Pruning shrubs
Tenants are often expected to maintain the appearance of the property’s garden. Consider garden maintenance as those jobs that need to be done regularly. A tenant’s garden responsibilities therefore often include:
Cleaning Lawn mowing Weeding
Sweeping surfaces
The landlord should outline to the tenant how they’re expected to maintain the garden or outdoor space. This will be part of the condition of the tenancy.
What is covered by landlord garden maintenance? 
As with the property itself, the garden should be maintained so it’s in the same condition at the end of the rental period as it was at the start.
It’s unreasonable for a landlord to expect a tenant to carry out improvements to a garden if it was in a mess from the start.
Some garden responsibilities will fall to the landlord, as outlined above (trees, hedges, shrubs, etc.), but general upkeep (sweeping, cleaning, and lawn mowing) will be down to the tenant.
If a tree has fallen in the rental property garden, it’s the landlord’s responsibility to have it removed, as long as the damage was not caused by the tenant.
Where a landlord has included specific garden maintenance jobs for the tenant in the tenancy agreement, they should provide the necessary tools or equipment for this. The landlord should also make sure an RCD-protected electrical supply (an electrical supply with a circuit breaker to prevent electrocution) is in place, and provide safety gloves.
In some cases, a landlord will  employ a gardener  to maintain the garden on a regular basis. Again, dependent on the terms of the tenancy agreement, a landlord may pay the lion’s share of this cost, or they may include this cost in the monthly rent (if previously agreed). Disputing landlord or tenant garden maintenance These are our top tips to help avoid disputes over landlord or tenant garden maintenance:
Clearly outline the expectations for garden maintenance in the tenancy agreement.
Take photos of the garden during the property inventory check at the start of the rental. Date these photos for future comparison.
Take a sensible deposit from the tenant at the start of the tenancy to cover any costs that might occur due to damage or neglect by the tenant.
Ensure regular landlord checks to make sure the garden is being maintained as per the tenancy agreement.
As a landlord, make sure adequate buildings insurance is in place to cover any accidental and malicious damage by tenants and their guests.
A longer-term rental often works out better if the property has a garden, as the tenant is more likely to have a vested interest in maintaining the outdoor space for their own enjoyment.
For peace of mind that the garden in your rental property is being well-maintained, search for a local gardener who can take on this responsibility for you.

Find a gardener your neighbours recommend  FAQs Does a landlord have to provide gardening tools?
If the tenancy agreement outlines certain gardening responsibilities for the tenant, the landlord should provide the gardening tools or equipment in order for the tenant to complete these jobs. For example, if it’s the tenant’s responsibility to mow the lawn, the landlord should provide mowing equipment.
Do tenants have to pay for garden maintenance?
If a gardener is employed by the landlord to maintain their rental property, the cost can be applied to a tenant’s rent if they’ve previously agreed to this.
Can a landlord claim for gardening?
Around  16% of Tenancy Deposit Scheme Insured disputes are centred around gardens and their maintenance . If the responsibilities for garden maintenance, as set out in the tenancy agreement, aren’t met, it’s possible for the landlord to impose fines. Without a tenancy agreement garden maintenance clause written, a landlord is unable to make a claim for garden maintenance should an issue arise.
Can you garden in a rental?
A tenant is not allowed to alter or change the landscaping of a rental property without the landlord’s permission. It’s a legal requirement for the tenant to gain the landlord’s approval before changing the garden in any way, even to make improvements. Failure to do so could allow the landlord to charge the tenant the cost of returning the garden to its original state.
Can my landlord tell me to cut the grass?
If the tenant has signed a tenancy agreement that stipulates the tenant is responsible for garden maintenance, a landlord can tell a tenant to cut the grass. A landlord should provide the mowing equipment in order to do this, but mowing the lawn is considered a garden maintenance job, the responsibility for which sits with the tenant.
What does garden maintenance include?
Garden maintenance generally refers to the appearance of the garden and refers to tasks that should be done regularly. Typically, this includes cleaning, lawn mowing, weeding, and sweeping surfaces.

How to start a glass glazier business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-start-a-glass-glazier-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a glass glazier business

Glass and glazing trades offer an important service for both commercial businesses and homeowners, making it great industry to get into if you’re thinking of starting up a new business. Some contractors specialise in large flagship builds, but most earn a profitable livelihood by offering their services to smaller builds, residential properties and other ad-hoc work.
In short, this sector offers excellent opportunities for those aspiring to go self-employed. This guide covers off everything you need to know for how to start up a glass glazing business – from the tools and skills needed, to business planning and marketing.
What does a glass glazier do? 
Glass glaziers fit, install and repair the glass found in windows and doors. They work across different builds, including both commercial and residential properties, though often specialise in one area. Glaziers will usually refer to blueprints to figure out the size and shape of glass they’re working with, and will cut, install and remove material where necessary.
They might also be trained in manufacturing glazed units. As a local glazier, you are paid for choosing the right replacement glass, removing any old or broken pieces, preparing frames, fitting new glass and making it watertight for customers.
How to become a glass glazier 
There is no set path when setting up a glass glazier business but there are a few common routes for entering the trade. Formal qualifications aren’t essential but you’ll definitely need some experience before you can build up a client list.
If you’re completely new to the trade, you should look into gaining on-site experience through a glazing apprenticeship such as intermediate level glazing, construction or fenestration installation. Alternatively, you could look for entry-level jobs with experienced installers and work your way up until you’re comfortable going it alone.
If you already have some experience and just want to demonstrate to customers, you’re competent, it’s worth studying for a Level 2 NVQ certificate in glazing or looking into courses provided by recognised trade bodies like the  UK Glass and Glazing  Federation. You’ll need to pay for this, but it will be a great way to show you’re serious and follow best practice.
Skills
You’ll need a mix of technical skills and some business basics to get your company off the ground. Here is a list of some of the most important skills you’ll need for the glass glazing sector:
Customer service– You’ll need to have strong interpersonal skills to be able to build good relationships with your clients and communicate effectively to meet their expectations
Basic maths – You’ll need to be familiar with how to work out fitting size measurements as a regular part of the job
Fitness – This sector is physically demanding so you’ll need to be in good health to be able to take on difficult jobs
Attention to detail – Glass glazing is all about getting it right down to the last square metre, so you’ll need to be very focused and spot errors before it’s too late

Measuring, cutting, removing, finishing – glaziers do all of these on a daily basis. As such, you’ll need to buy some high-quality tools to do the job properly. Here’s a list of the essentials:
Gloves
Glazier Hammer
Tape Measure
Glass Gun
Putty Knife
Block Lever
Window Scraper
Sealant of Caulk Gun
Glass Cutter
Suction Cups
Circular Glass Cutter
Glass Drill Bit
Suction Lifter
Glass Snips
Utility Knife
Needle Nose Pliers
Pry Bar
Hex Keys
Humidity and Temperature Sensor
Safety Glasses – very important to prevent accidents
As a glazier, you should always carry a full first aid kit. Protective clothing and safety shoes are also recommended. If you’re employing a small team, make sure you’ve also got all the right PPE that’s needed to trade safely and minimise hazards.
Starting your glass glazier business
One of the first things you’ll need to decide is what types of services you’ll offer. With glass glazing, there’s a wide range you can choose from, including specialisms like emergency call-outs. Some options include:
Disposal and repairs
Commercial fitting, such as shop windows and offices
Domestic fitting, including greenhouses and other outdoor buildings
Roof and sky light fitting
Don’t forget there’s also many different types of glass to consider, including single, double and utility glazing. Make sure your training and skills match up with these areas – you don’t want to take on a job where your skills aren’t properly matched.
Standing out from competitors
Most glazing companies carry out replacement and installation, but those looking to specialise could focus on a specific sector like hotels or shops. Restoration work for listed buildings, churches and historical structures could be another avenue worth looking into if you’re searching for something a little different. Remember you’ll need to make sure there’s enough work in your local area, so research before settling on any niche.
Glazier businesses that offer an emergency service will get great word-of-mouth referrals and are easy to market. Clients also may want to work with greener construction methods in the near future, so specialising in this area could be a great asset which marks you out.

Registering your glass glazier business 
Deciding whether to register your business as a sole trader or limited company can be a tricky choice. Consider the long-term plan and whether you’ll be employing a team of tradespeople to help you as this will make the decision easier.
Limited companies will offer greater legal and financial security, so this will work out better if you plan on growing a team with lots of retained contracts. If you want to build a strong reputation as an independent trader relying on local ad-hoc business, registering as a sole trader will likely be a better choice. For a full breakdown, read our guide  here .
Business plan 
Once you’ve settled on registration, it’s time to put together a business plan. Doing your homework will help you to assess the kind of start-up and ongoing costs you’re going to be faced with. The services you decide to offer will also shape your customer base and how you market to them. Key points to cover in your plan include:
Short, mid- and long-term goals
Target market and volume of customers in different areas
Competitors
Opportunities for growth
Demand for specialist services
Ingoings and outgoings, including taxes
Yearly projections
Recruitment
There’s a lot of paperwork when starting a new business and some of this might be unfamiliar to you. Taxes are especially important to get right as you can be fined for improper filing. If you’re unsure about what you need to do, you could always hire an accountant to help – read more about that  here .
Pricing
Look at what competitors are charging for their services and match yours up against them. Your prices should always reflect the type of service you offer and how long it will take to complete. You will also need to factor in technical aspects that might prolong the job. For example, you should charge a higher premium rate for large, difficult installation work on listed buildings.
Most glass glaziers will charge for installation work on an hourly or daily basis, adding the cost of any materials bought to the grand total. While you want your prices to be attractive to new customers, don’t go too low as you may be eating into your profit margins. Business loans can help if you’re worried about cashflow in the early days – just remember to read the terms carefully and make repayments on time.
Marketing to homeowners
Focus on building good relationships with clients and ensure the business’s name is spread word-of-mouth in your local area. Securing an advertisement in a newspaper is an effective way to get started, as it will raise awareness in nearby neighbourhoods and get the ball rolling. Social media can also be used with local hashtags and targeted ads to get in front of homeowners that are actively looking for services like yours.
Once you’ve done a good job on a few homes, people will likely share your good work with neighbours and friends who are also in need of glazing or other glass services. If this creates a steady pipeline of work, you can always dial back on your digital spending.
Don’t forget about door-to-door leaflets and vehicle graphics either – these always drum up new business and get your name out there without too much effort. Just keep an eye out for junk mail notices as it will irritate homeowners if you ignore them.
Marketing to other businesses
Often the first thing businesses do when looking for a tradesperson is check online directories and reviews. That’s why a  Checkatrade membership  is vital for those starting up a new business. Upon joining, your business will be visible to over three million monthly site users who could become your customers. Not only does membership raise your online profile, but also lets you showcase images of your finest work and display customer recommendations to enhance your reputation.
You could also contact local residential landlord associations to enquire about being included in their supplier’s guide – this is especially important if you’re looking for the bigger contracts on new-build sites. Remember networking events are also useful ways to get in front of the people that matter. Have informal chats with decision-makers – you can always leave them a business card and take the conversation further if they show interest.
Insurance for your glass glazier business
Glass is a delicate material and accidents can always happen, so make sure you’re covered should the worst happen.
Glazier’s insurance will be a top priority – You will only pay for what you need and many companies provide quotes for trades, shop around for the best price
Tools, plant and machinery insurance – This will cover replacement costs should your equipment be stolen, damaged or lost Public liability insurance  – Most professional glaziers will get this insurance to cover costs for any accidents and injuries Employers’ liability cover  – This insurance is essential to cover claims from employees or contractors you hire
FAQs
How much can I earn as a self-employed glass glazier?
The average annual salary for a glazier is roughly £32,500 per year in the UK. But you could earn far more than this if your business is successful.
What is the hourly rate for glass glazier businesses?
In the UK, the average glazier hourly pay is between £8-£16, but this will depend largely on what the job consists of. Complexity, materials supplied, replacements and repairs will all be factors which affect what you charge
Is glass glazing a profitable business?
You can be sure that glass glazing isn’t going out of business any time soon, so there will always be a market for you. What you take home will also grow as you become more established and are able to branch out and offer more specialist services.

Building near trees: All you need to know,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/building-near-trees/,Tag Not Found,"Building near trees: All you need to know

One of the best things about living in the UK is the abundance of nature everywhere you go. When it comes to building however, trees can either be considered a valued asset or a huge inconvenience. While they offer shelter and environmental benefits, they can have an effect on any nearby structures.
So, if you come across a job where trees are an issue, this guide on building near trees is perfect for you. After reading this article, you’ll know all about the risk of building near trees. We’ll also be looking at building near trees with preservation orders, building regulations for foundations, and how close to a tree you can safely build.
Building near trees – Integrity and foundations
Most homeowners appreciate some greenery in their gardens and trees are a great choice. However, as a tradesperson you’ll find trees can be a real hinderance to your projects.
In fact, building near trees can have a serious effect on the structural integrity of a home. This is due to the roots of the tree sucking moisture from the soil under or near to the building. This causes the earth to shrink and the foundations to shift.
To further complicate things, different sizes and types of tree will have differing effects on a structure so it’s important to consider this during your planning. Generally, clay soil is the most affected soil when it comes to building near trees, so you’ll need to ensure the foundations are deeper to counteract this.
Building near trees with preservation orders
Tree preservation orders or TPOs control whether or not you can cut down a tree. Any type of tree can be protected so you’ll need to check with your local authority before cutting down any unwanted trees. Please note, if you’re working within a conservation area then all trees will be protected and you’ll need to check with your local authority before making any changes.
You should always ensure you make a planning application when building a structure, that includes whether any trees will be impacted by your plans. You can then check whether any trees are under a TPO. Remember, cutting down a protected tree is a criminal offence with fines of up to £2,000.
This all means that building near protected trees can be a real issue. So, what happens if there’s a tree near where you plan to build but it’s covered by a TPO? Well, luckily your local authority has the ability to revoke a TPO so they should be your first port of call.
NHBC standards chapter 4.2 guidance for building near trees
Chapter 4.2 of the NHBC standards covers guidance on building near trees and focuses on how foundations are affected by trees. It’s a handy document to read and refer to if you’re unsure how to work with a tree adjacent to where you plan to build. It also covers areas like soils, drainage, and heave precautions. You can find more information on the  NHBC standards website. Feeling a little confused? Why not consider

Building regulations for foundations near trees
As we mentioned previously, you’ll need to dig deeper foundations for certain trees that are close to where you plan to build. Foundation depth near trees is varied depending on how far away the tree is, the type of tree, the height of the tree and the soil type.
Building regulations for foundations near trees are also in place stating that foundations should be at least 900mm before you even take into account the effects of a tree. If you’re unsure how deep to dig foundations for your latest job, you can use an online building near trees calculator. Just enter a few details into the  online form  at LAPC warranty for quick results.
Building near different types of trees
Each type of tree will have a different root system to keep it supported and fed as it grows. This means you’ll need to adapt your building process depending on the type of tree you plan to build next to. When it comes to building near conifer trees and building near oak trees, both species can cause issues with foundations and if their roots are affected by your job, the trees will die.
Building walls near trees
Similar to the impact of trees on buildings and visa versa, building walls near trees can also cause issues. It’s never a good idea to build a wall over tree roots as the chances are that wall will become unstable and crack over time.
On the other hand, if you cut the tree’s roots, this could impact the health of the tree and cause it to die. As a general rule, it’s recommended that you build your wall at least the same distance away as the height of the tree. For example, if the tree is 10 foot tall, you should build the wall at least 10 foot away.

If you’re looking into starting your own construction company,  joining Checkatrade  is the perfect way to hit the ground running. With free marketing materials and access to millions of homeowners looking to hire a Checkatrade member, your new business will get an amazing start.

How close can you build to a tree?
This really depends on the height and type of tree, but ensure that you build at least the same distance away as the height of the tree.
Can you build an extension near a tree?
You can to a certain extent. If you build your extension too close to a tree, the extension and tree will be at risk.
Can you build under trees?
It’s not recommended as this can affect both the building and the tree.
Do trees affect foundations?
Yes, the tree’s roots can suck the moisture out from the soil under foundations, affecting their stability.
Useful checklist for building near trees
Before starting any construction project, consider the effect of any nearby trees.
Without sufficient distance, tree roots can cause buildings to become structurally unstable and buildings can cause trees to wither and die.
You should check with your local authority to see if a tree is covered by a TPO before you cut it down.
It’s a criminal offence to cut down a tree that’s protected under a TPO.
If you do need to build near a tree, it’s important to dig foundations deep enough to ensure your structure is as stable as possible.

How to stay under the VAT threshold,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/stay-under-vat-threshold/,Tag Not Found,"How to stay under the VAT threshold

VAT is something most tradespeople are aware of, and whether to become VAT registered is a key consideration for every business. In fact, in order to run a successful company, you’ll need to know your responsibilities when it comes to paying and charging VAT. Luckily, you may be able to avoid becoming VAT registered by learning how to stay under the VAT threshold.
This article covers vital issues like what happens if you go slightly over the VAT threshold, whether being VAT registered is the right choice for your business, and how to split your business to avoid VAT. So read on for everything you need to know about staying under the VAT threshold.
How to stay under VAT threshold
Ok, before we dive into how to stay under the VAT threshold, let’s take a closer look at what VAT is. VAT stands for Value Added Tax and is added when goods or services are sold in the UK. You’ll usually pay VAT when buying from your favourite store or you may need to add VAT to the cost of your services.
Knowing whether you need to register to pay VAT depends on your business turnover in the last 12 months. The VAT threshold is set at £85,000 so if your turnover exceeds this amount, you’ll need to become VAT registered.
There are a few ways to stay under the VAT threshold, one of which involves splitting your business to avoid VAT. You can break your company down into two or more separate businesses, but each part of your company needs to offer different services to make the distinction clear. You should also consider having separate bank accounts and you’ll need to complete two or more tax returns.
How to avoid paying VAT as a business
Knowing how to avoid paying VAT as a business can be handy when it comes to keeping prices for your services competitive. When you become VAT registered you won’t pay the VAT yourself, your customers will pay this instead, meaning you need to charge more. If you do need to charge VAT, this money will actually go to the government, you’ll just collect it on their behalf.
In addition, you can reclaim any VAT your business has paid on expenses over the same time period.
You can avoid paying VAT by making sure your business earns less than the £85,000 threshold. Other ways to prevent your company from paying VAT are to avoid getting your customers to purchase materials themselves, not taking large one-off payments, and operating on fewer days a week.
Going temporarily over the VAT threshold
If your business goes temporarily over the VAT threshold you may be able to ask the HMRC for an exception. Ensure this is submitted in writing less than 30 days after you go over the £85,000 threshold.
If you’re concerned going over the VAT threshold will affect your business,  joining Checkatrade  is a fantastic way to offset this. With our buyers club you can make huge savings on business essentials, and you can get support and advice through our members community.

Do you pay VAT on profit or turnover?
VAT is charged on your company’s turnover, not profits.
Useful checklist for how to stay under the VAT threshold
The VAT threshold is £85,000 and if your company turnover exceeds this, you’ll need to register to pay VAT.
You can stay under the VAT threshold by splitting your business, working less days, or not taking big one-off payments.

What size bath do I need for my project?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/what-size-bath/,Tag Not Found,"What size bath do I need for my project?

Choosing a bath is often one of the most important considerations when having a new bathroom fitted. Often the largest fixture in a bathroom, the rest of the space will usually be designed around the bath itself. This means you’ll need to work closely with your customers, helping to properly measure the space and explain the different options available.
Your role is to guide the consumer into picking the best bath to fit the space. So, whilst on a job you may be wondering “what size bath do I need?” Don’t worry, this guide is designed to cover everything you need to know about deciding on a bath. Today we’ll be looking into different bath sizes, how to pick the perfect bath, how to correctly measure bathtub size, and answering your FAQs.
What size bath do I need?
Before you advise your customer on what size bath to purchase, it’s worth explaining the different types of bath available. Each bath style will be shaped differently and take up differing amounts of space. The options include:
Corner baths
Straight baths
P shaped baths
L shaped baths
Free standing baths
Whirlpool baths
It’s also worth considering that different consumers use baths in different ways. Ask your customer what they’ll be primarily using the bath for. For example, if the bath will be used for bathing children and dogs, a good size straight bath should be fine. However, if relaxation is the main use, it may be worth choosing a whirlpool or freestanding bath.
What size bath should I get?
Once you’ve discussed your customer’s needs, you’ll want to know ‘what size bath should I get?’. Firstly, think about how tall your customer is. Someone over 6 foot will need a longer bath to allow them to fully relax, while a bath that’ll only be used to bathe a child won’t need to be very long.
Next, look at the size of the bathroom. If the space is very small, you won’t want to obstruct access to other parts of the room. What’s more, if there’s already a bath in place, your customer may simply want a like for like replacement so you’ll need to take a little time to properly measure the old tub.
Buying bathroom tools and materials
When you’ve come to a decision about the right bath for your customer, you’ll need to buy the bath itself.  Joining Checkatrade  means not only will you be a valued member of the UK’s leading trade directory, but you’ll also receive great discounts on business essentials like tools and materials as part of our Buyers Club.
How to measure bathtub size
It’s incredibly important to be careful when measuring for a bath as ordering the wrong size will mean unhappy customers and wasted time for you. We’d always recommend measuring twice to be completely sure your readings are accurate.
Use the following steps to measure bathtub size:
Length
: Usually the distance from one wall to the next or if the bath is a direct replacement, measure the length of the old bath.
Width
: Take the distance from one side of the bath to the other. If you’re adding a differently sized bath, measure across the space where you want the bath to sit.
Height:
 Take a measurement from the ground to the height you want the bath to reach.
Freestanding
: If the bath will be freestanding, you should take measurements from the widest parts of the bath. This will usually be the top edges.
Taps
: Always make sure to leave enough space for any taps
Obstructions
: Check that the bath won’t obstruct access to other parts of the bathroom or the door.
If you have any concerns about measuring for oddly sized baths or the right methods to use, why not become a  Checkatrade member . You’ll have access to our members community, an online space where you can chat with other tradespeople, getting advice and support. Plus, Checkatrade generates twice as many jobs as other platforms*, helping to grow your business.

What are the standard UK bath sizes?
Most baths will come in standard sizes, this makes it easier for manufacturers to size their new baths. Generally, the standard UK bath size is 1700mm by 700mm, while a large bath is 1800mm by 800mm and a small bath is 1400mm by 700mm.
What is the average bath capacity in litres?
Every bath will have a different capacity for water, depending on its width, length, and height. But the average bath capacity is 100 litres.
How big should a bath be?
This will mainly depend on the size of the bathroom, who’ll be using the bath and what its purpose will be. For example, a bath used for relaxation by a tall customer will work best if it’s a larger size like 1800mm by 800mm.
What should be the minimum size of a bath?
If your customer’s bathroom is very small, then they’ll likely want to add a more compact bathtub. The minimum size bath that’s widely available will be 1400mm by 700mm.
Is a 1500mm freestanding bath too small?
This will depend on your customer’s height and how they plan to use the bath. A tall person may find this length of bath uncomfortable but for bathing a child it’ll work perfectly.
What is a good size for a soaking tub?
Soaking tubs are designed for comfort and relaxation above all else and a longer, deeper tub is recommended for a more immersive experience. In fact, soaking tubs can be found on the market ranging from 1500mm long to 2200mm long.
What is the most popular size for a bathtub?
The most popular size of bathtub today is 1700mm by 700mm.
Useful checklist for determining what size bath you need
Choosing a bath is an essential part of planning a new bathroom and the right bath for your customer will depend on its intended use and who’ll be using it.
Baths often come in a standard size of 1700mm by 700mm but are available in a range of other options.
There are a wide variety of bath types, ranging from standard straight baths to whirlpool and corner baths.

Best jobs to retrain for at 50,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/best-jobs-to-retrain-for-at-50/,Tag Not Found,"Best jobs to retrain for at 50

Starting a new career at any age can be daunting, not least at 50 when other colleagues might be considering retirement after full-time employment. But heading down a different path at this age isn’t as overwhelming or difficult as many are led to believe.
If you’re looking for a new challenge, or interested in trying something new, you may want to consider retraining as a tradesperson. It’s never too late and can be a hugely rewarding experience, especially if you’ve come from a sector that doesn’t offer much job satisfaction. Every day is different for trades and if you go self-employed, you’ll be able to choose your own hours and the types customers you work for.
Whether you’ve got some earlier trade experience or just looking to learn on the way, this guide is for you. We’ve put together a list of the best jobs to retrain for at 50 and included an overview of benefits and qualifications needed to help you decide.
Career change at 50 ideas
While there is no consensus for what the ‘best’ career path is for someone in their 50s, retraining as a tradesperson is definitely one of the smarter choices.
There are countless opportunities for qualified tradespeople in the UK right now. The government, for example, is pushing for more new build housing, so the country will need a lot more workers capable of building new properties and providing water and electricity for them in the coming years. This boom will of course run alongside all the usual maintenance, renovation and upgrade work that takes place each day.
Trade professions are a popular choice for people at this age, especially those that have come from a desk-based job. You’re on the move most days, mainly working with your hands and can quickly progress once qualified. Being older, you will also have gained knowledge that employers really value. But this equally applies to those interested in setting up their own business.
With courses available and life experience valued, there’s plenty of opportunities out there for you to consider. The following list is by no means complete and gives an overview of some of the best options. Ultimately your decision will be based on personal circumstances and the experience you have gained to date.
Building surveying
Those who have worked in an engineering field will feel at home moving into building surveying, but even those with no experience will enjoy this job. Tradespeople in this field inspect all visible and accessible parts of a building, including roofs, walls, floors, windows and doors, chimneys, garages, basements and outbuildings. They will give clients advice on the structural integrity of a build and will make suggestions for improvements where needed.
Benefits
The work is not desk bound so you’ll be on site and not tied to your screen
This role is very varied and no two days are the same
Graduate building surveyors can expect to earn around £22,000-£26,000. With a few years’ experience you’ll earn in the region of £28,000-£50,000 and at senior level this can rise to £70,000 or more
Experience or qualifications needed for building surveying  
The quickest way to become a building surveyor is to study for a building surveying undergraduate degree that’s been approved by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and/or the Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB). This takes three years full time
You can also move into this field by studying for a building surveying postgraduate ‘conversion course’. This also needs to be approved by RICS and/or the CIOB and can last either nine months or a year full time, depending on the type of qualification.
There are a few building surveying apprenticeships available and many of these apprenticeships are organised through the Chartered Surveyors’ Training Trust
You’ll typically work towards a professional qualification known as chartership awarded by RICS – you can read more about that  here .
If you’re looking for an entry-level job instead, you could apply for a building surveying technician job with a higher national diploma (HND)
Carpenters
Carpentry is one of the world’s oldest trades and incredibly fulfilling. Since carpenters are always in demand, you’ll have no problem finding plenty of paid work once you’re qualified. It’s also an excellent trade for starting up your own business – read more about that  here .
Benefits
Easily start your own business and be your own boss
More flexible working hours
Increased earning potential – £31,600 national average UK salary
Satisfying career that you truly enjoy – see your designs come to life
Great personal and professional development opportunities
Experience or qualifications needed for carpentry  
There are fast-track training courses that allow you to learn the skills and gain the essential qualifications required of a carpenter in a few weeks, allowing you to bypass the traditional college course route
You’ll need to be good with your hands and comfortable using different tools
Some up-front costs will be needed for machinery, tools and a workshop space
Skilled tradespeople get your business started 
Join Checkatrade today  Join Now Electricians
Electricians are some of the highest-earning tradespeople so if you’d like a career that requires no degree and is easy on the physical labour side of things, look no further.
Benefits
A fantastic salary of approximately £32,000 a year, rising with experience
Flexibility – with the current skills shortage, it’s possible to find work as an electrician virtually anywhere in the UK
Be your own boss – qualified electricians can pick the jobs that suit them, with this freedom allowing you to pick your schedule
Great trade for starting up your own firm – get started with that  here .
Experience or qualifications needed for electricians  
Training as an electrician once took up to three years as it required studying in college and undertaking an apprenticeship in order to qualify. But now there are courses available that are designed to get you qualified in as little as six months!
Once you’ve been trained online and got some experience, you’ll do a final assessment. If you pass, you’ll be able to legally trade as an electrician and work on a wide range of projects
Plumbers
Getting into plumbing is easier than in many other lines of work and is a common profession to retrain for at 50 – the potential earnings are a big reason why. Like electricians, this trade is always in demand and there’s the opportunity to work on some impressive projects. Again, this is another excellent industry to set up your own business and reap the rewards of self-employment. Head over to our handy guide about that by clicking  here .
Benefits
The average salary for a plumber in the UK is £16.51 per hour, but self-employment can see this rise by a lot more
Great opportunities to start a new business
If you retrain as an adult, you’ll likely earn more than average in your first role – you could also take home extra by  becoming registered to work with gas Job freedom and variety
Experience or qualifications needed for plumbers 
Your two main entry routes are to become a plumber’s mate or complete a fast-track plumbing course. It’s best to retrain through a course if you want to increase your earning potential and land a job quickly.
Gas engineers
Gas engineering is a highly rewarding profession with excellent career prospects. Working with gas requires some training beforehand, but once passed you’ll be an approved engineer in high demand.
Plumbers often retrain as gas engineers in their 50s due to the increased salary and ability to attract a wider client base. But even if you have no prior trade experience, it’s still a great option for those interested in a challenge. For a complete overview of the Gas Safe register and how to start your own gas engineering business – click  here .
Benefits
Excellent salary, often more than £40,000 per year
High demand in all parts of the UK
Ability to start up your own firm
Stable market and easy route to self-employment
Experience or qualifications needed for gas engineering 
You’ll first need to take a  gas engineering course  and become Gas-Safe registered – this involves training for assessments which can take as little as 25 weeks with experienced training providers
Jobs for 50-year-olds with no experience
Trade businesses offer something very different and exciting for those who have spent several years in the same career. With demand so high for trained professionals, many of the requirements are now being relaxed to get more people into work. This is
a great opportunity for people who have little or no experience in a trade-related field.
The same can be said for those that do have experience under their belt but are considering learning a new trade. While this may sound daunting at first, you’ll soon realise that many of the skills you’ve learned in another job will apply in your new career – especially if you’re keen on setting up your own business at some point.
Job training programs for over 50s
There are many training academies that offer accredited training courses for different trades. Some will get you qualified in a short space of time, while others may need more of your time to get passed. Either way, there’s no shortage of options and it’s very likely there’s something nearby, so you won’t have to travel too far. You can explore the available options through the National Careers Service which offers apprenticeships or a skills health check to help you plan your next career path.
FAQs
What is the best career to start at 50?
There isn’t a single answer to this question, as it will depend on what you enjoy, how much you want to earn and if you’re willing to study again. That said, retraining for a new role in your 50s is becoming very common, so don’t feel discouraged by being a latecomer to a new trade.
What new jobs can I do at 50?
The sky’s the limit! But just make sure you’re happy with the physical demands of some trades. Plumbing, for example, is harder on the body than building surveying, so keep that in mind when choosing a new direction.
What is a good second career for someone over 50?
Finding the ‘right’ career is never easy but trades offer a good balance of earning potential and variety. Transferable skills and life experience will also set you up for success if you’re keen on running your own company.
Is 50 too old to start a new career?
Never. There are loads of options, even for people with little experience, and age shouldn’t be a factor. As long as you’re keen and physically able to complete the work, you’ll find great success in your new career.

What to do if you have hard water,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/hard-water/,"Bathroom, Kitchen","What to do if you have hard water

In This Blog: Signs of hard water How hard is my water? How to soften hard water How to remove hard water stains FAQs Hard water can cause a variety of costly and frustrating problems within the home. Read on to find out what the signs of hard water are and what to do if you have hard water. Signs of hard water Some tell-tale signs of hard water include:
Limescale deposits and damage to appliances, such as the kettle and washing machine
Water stains or ‘scale’ on surfaces such as the shower screen, taps, and glassware
Blocked pipes and boilers, which can manifest as low water pressure (and potentially a broken boiler)
Worsening skin complaints, such as eczema
If this sounds familiar, read on to learn how to determine how hard your water is, how to soften hard water, and how to remove those unsightly water stains. How hard is my water? More than 13 million households in the UK are affected by hard water.
Determining how hard your water is is largely down to where you live. The South East of England and London water hardness levels are predominantly high. Generally, Scotland, Ireland and Wales have soft water. Hard water is measured in parts per million (PPM).  The volume of particles of hardness dissolved in the water per million particles gives a rating of water hardness.
0 – 50 PPM is considered soft water
101 – 150 PPM is slightly hard water
201 – 275 PPM is hard water
A rating of 350+ PPM would be classed as aggressively hard water
To find out the water hardness where you live, use the postcode checker facility on your local water provider’s website.

Find a water softener installer near you  How to soften hard water Hard water can often do the most damage to hot water appliances, for example, your boiler, kettle, or washing machine. When hard water is heated, it leaves behind the minerals responsible for hard water – calcium and magnesium – which solidify into scale.
Over time, the build-up of scale can narrow the pathway inside your pipes, reducing the flow of water. This can result in low water pressure. Scale can also build up on the outside of water fixtures, such as taps and the showerhead, causing a reduced water flow.
So how do you soften hard water to avoid all of this?
The best way to make hard water soft is to install a water softener. A water softener is a filtering system that removes calcium and magnesium minerals from your water. With a water softener you’ll:
Prolong the lifespan of pipes and home appliances.
Enjoy healthier skin and hair (especially important if you suffer from eczema or a dry scalp).
Reduce the number of cleaning products you use as you won’t be battling the build-up of scale.
Use less detergent in your laundry, and your washing will feel softer and cleaner.
Save money.
A water softener installer will visit your home to conduct a survey. Based on this, they will be able to recommend the right water softening system to suit your needs.
Cost of installing a water softener
A water softener will typically cost between 
£400 – £630
. However, there are many different types of water softener, and you can pay up to 
£2,000
 if you opt for top-of-the-range. While the cost can seem high, a water softening system is an investment to help avoid the costly repair or replacement of damaged appliances due to hard water.
To have a water softener installed will cost on average 
£225
. The other option is to rent a water softener. The cost for this is around 
£22 per month
, which includes the cost of installation. Either way, you will need to budget for water softener salt (around 
£9 for 10kg
) and salt blocks (around 
£39 for a pack of 6
).
Check out our  water softener cost  guide for further information.

Find a water softener installer near you  How to remove hard water stains Want to know how to remove hard water stains? Here are our top tips: 
Mix equal parts white vinegar and fresh water in a spray bottle and use it as you would a general bathroom cleaner. This solution can be applied to sinks, taps, shower screens, baths and tiles. Rinse thoroughly with plain water afterwards and buff with a microfibre cloth.
To tackle hard water stains on a showerhead, remove the showerhead and soak it overnight in a solution of equal parts white vinegar and fresh water. Carefully use a needle to gently poke any remaining scale out of the jet holes.
To remove scale from the inside of your kettle, fill the kettle with a solution of half water and half white vinegar and leave overnight. Rinse thoroughly the next morning to make sure you remove any vinegary odours.
To freshen up and remove scale from your dishwasher, fill a cup with white vinegar and place it on the top rack of the machine. Run the dishwasher on its hottest setting.
To reduce scale build-up in your washing machine, add a large cup of white vinegar or lemon juice in place of detergent and run the machine empty on a normal cycle.

Find a water softener installer near you  FAQs What is hard water?
Hard water is water that contains an excess of calcium and magnesium minerals. The concentration of which depends on where you live.
What makes water hard?
Water is naturally soft when it falls from the sky. What makes it ‘hard’ is the ground it comes into contact with. Therefore, if rainwater lands on an area of porous rock, e.g. limestone, it passes through the rock and picks up dissolved particles and minerals such as calcium and magnesium, resulting in hard water.
What is the difference between hard water and soft water?
The hardness or softness of water is determined by the volume of dissolved minerals calcium and magnesium. The addition of these minerals in hard water changes its structure, which results in scale deposits on household appliances and pipes.

Are solar panels worth it?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/are-solar-panels-worth-it/,Roof,"Are solar panels worth it?

In This Blog: What’s the benefit of having solar panels? Is my house right for solar panels? How much does solar panel installation cost? Earning money from your solar panels Maintenance costs of solar panels in the UK Always consult a solar panel installation expert FAQs Solar panels are a great way to reduce your home’s carbon footprint and power your home and can prove to be a worthwhile investment in the right circumstances. However, installing solar panels on your property is a big decision, so it’s important to do your research before jumping into it. We’ve put together this expert guide to help you find out if solar panels are worth it for you, your home and your pocket. What’s the benefit of having solar panels? The main benefit of switching to solar is how much money you can save on your energy bills. The average UK home uses 
3,760 kWh of electricity per year
 and the average UK domestic solar panel system generates between 
2,400 and 3,200 kWh per year
. Based on this, you could save between 63% – 85% on your annual electricity bills by installing solar panels on your roof.
As well as the financial savings, there’s also the carbon footprint reduction. Generating 3,000 kWh of electricity through solar panels instead of a gas-fired power station will save around a tonne of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.
Plus, by creating your own power supply, you’re also not at the mercy of power cuts and price rises. Is my house right for solar panels? There are three main factors to consider here, roof size, roof direction and roof integrity.
Is your roof big enough for solar panels?
Based on average UK weather, you’ll want to install a minimum of 3 kilowatts of solar panels on your roof. Taking the average size of a solar panel, this equates to an area of 20m2.
You can work out the rough roof size of your roof by measuring the length and width in metres of your building where it meets the ground. Then multiply the two numbers to give you your total roof area in m2. But remember that you’ll probably only be installing panels on one side, so halve the number for a more accurate figure.
The direction your house faces matters
As you’d expect, a south-facing roof is best for harvesting sunlight. If your solar panels are south-facing, you can expect to generate around 20% more electricity than if they were east- or west-facing.
Roof integrity is key
Although relatively light, it’s crucial to make sure your roof can safely take the weight of solar panels. For this reason, it’s essential to get a solar panel installation expert to come and assess your roof as a first step in your project.
Simply enter your postcode in the free search tool below to find local solar panel specialists recommended by your neighbours.

Find solar panel installers recommended by your neighbours  How much does solar panel installation cost? The cost of your solar panel installation will depend on a number of factors, including:
The type of panels you want
The amount of energy you want to generate
The size and type of your property
The direction in which your roof faces
The quality of components you require
Whether you want a battery or not
On average, you should expect to pay between 
£5,000 – £8,000 
for the supply and installation of a Photovoltaic (PV) solar panel system and between 
£4,000 – £5,000
 for a thermal solar panel system. Take a look at our guide on the  cost of solar panel installation  for more information and to find out about the different types of solar panels available. Earning money from your solar panels Solar panels can generate more power than is needed in a home, which means you could have spare electricity. As most solar panel installations don’t include a battery, this electricity is sent to the national grid to be used by other properties.
The  Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) scheme , launched in January 2020 in England, Scotland and Wales, means you’re paid for any surplus electricity you contribute to the grid. The amount you’re paid depends on the tariff set by your energy supplier, so to find out it’s best to contact them.
Top tip:
 When your solar panels are installed, it may be worth switching suppliers to find the best SEG scheme tariff. Maintenance costs of solar panels in the UK Lifetime maintenance costs on solar panels are relatively low, here’s a breakdown:
Service:
 You should set aside between 
£100 – £200 a year
 for an  annual service  by a solar panel specialist.
Cleaning:
 To keep your system efficient you should get your panels cleaned by an expert very six months, which chould cost between 
£4 – £15 per panel
. You can find out more in our  solar panel cleaning cost  guide.
Inverter: 
With an average lifespan of around 25 years, your inverter will last a long time before needing replacing. When it does, expect to pay between 
£800 – £1,000.
You can find a more detailed breakdown of costs to consider in our  solar panel maintenance cost  guide. Always consult a solar panel installation expert Hopefully, you now have an understanding of the costs involved in installing solar panels and a clearer idea of whether solar panels are worth it for your property. It goes without saying that the installation of solar panels should only be completed by a professional, as it’s a complex process and the health and financial risks if it goes wrong are significant.
Thankfully, it’s easy to get quotes and advice from trusted local solar panel experts that are recommended by your neighbours. Simply enter your postcode in the free search tool below to get started.

Find solar panel installers recommended by your neighbours  FAQs Will solar panels affect the value of my home?
The general view on this is no. Most estate agents will tell you solar panels make no positive or negative difference to the value of your property. Any uplift you did see, if, for example, your buyer was particularly sustainability-minded, would unlikely be greater than the cost of installation.
What will be the payback time on my solar panels?
Based on figures from the  Energy Saving Trust , it can take between 11- 27 years to see the cost of your installation repaid to you in savings and surplus electricity payments.
Your exact payback period will depend on your location in the UK, the direction your panels face and how much electricity you use. An expert will be able to provide an accurate cost-benefit analysis of solar panels based on your situation.
Can I get free solar panels?
While free solar panels were offered by companies in the past, there’s no way to get free solar panels in 2021. Although the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) scheme does mean you’re paid for any surplus electricity you generate, meaning you can offset your overall cost of installation.
Do I need planning permission for solar panels?
In the UK, the installation of solar panels on a house roof is classed as  permitted development , and as such you usually won’t need planning permission. You will still need building regulations sign off though, particularly as they will be positioned on your property’s roof structure.

Using recycled building materials,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/using-recycled-building-materials/,Tag Not Found,"Using recycled building materials

In This Blog: What are reclaimed building materials? What are the benefits of recycled building materials? Tips for recycling and the reuse of building materials How to recycle home building materials Is my project right for reclaimed building materials? How much do used building materials cost? Where to find reclaimed building materials What are the best ways to save money when building a house? FAQs The idea of building using recycled materials may seem strange, but there are lots of benefits in doing so. Reclaimed building materials can have a lower cost than new materials, plus they’re an environmentally friendly option for sustainable home construction. Find out everything you need to know about using used building materials for your construction project. What are reclaimed building materials? Used, recycled or reclaimed building materials are essentially bricks, tiles, wood and other materials that have already been part of a building. Typically, these come from a property that has been demolished, and the reusable materials have been salvaged by the demolition company to be sold on. What are the benefits of recycled building materials? The main benefits of going for used building materials over brand new are cost, sustainability and uniqueness.
Cost:
 In some cases, recycled building materials are cheaper than buying new ones, which can significantly reduce the overall cost of your construction project.
Sustainable:
 Used materials can be classed as environmentally friendly building materials because no new carbon emissions or chemical bi-products have been produced in their manufacture. They already existed, and at the very most the only carbon footprint is related to their delivery and use.
Uniqueness: 
Unlike mass-produced materials, recycled building materials can be one-offs or no longer produced, which brings a unique element to the design and finish of your property.

Find your local builder today  Tips for recycling and the reuse of building materials If you want to give the environment a helping hand, recycling and the reuse of building materials is the way to go. Rather than being old and damaged, recycled materials have stood the test of time and are a natural way of enhancing the structure and appearance of your property.
Recycled materials can often be found at reclamation yards and may include:
Plastic
Masonry
Timber
Steel and other metals
Concrete
Wiring
Insulation
Plumbing fixtures How to recycle home building materials Some of the most common uses for recycled materials are listed below but there are also other ways these materials can be used:
Metal:
 Once metal is melted down it can be transformed into the perfect shape and size materials for your project.
Concrete: 
Can be used in driveways, paths, and patios as a solid foundation.
Timber:
 Can be used for flooring, decoration, and outside decking. Is my project right for reclaimed building materials? The challenge with reclaimed building materials is supply and volume. As you’d expect, the unique nature of used bricks, for example, is that there will only be as many as were removed from another site. This means there may not be enough if you’re planning on using them to build an entire home.
The best thing to do is locate the right amount of reclaimed materials you need for your entire project before committing to a particular style. This way you know you’ll have enough alternative building materials to finish the job. It’s always worth speaking to your local builder to find out
Using recycled building materials on an extension
Used building materials are particularly ideal for extension projects. This is because your home’s existing bricks may not be manufactured anymore, so by using reclaimed bricks you may be able to find the same ones of ones similar to match the rest of your property.
Used materials are also ideal for an extension because of ageing. Even if you can still buy the bricks that were used to build your house, new ones will look different to your existing ones as they will be brand new, not aged. By using reclaimed building materials from a similar aged property, you can match the look ensuring your extension looks like it has always been part of your property. How much do used building materials cost? Due to the wide range of reclaimed building materials available, costs can vary greatly. Here’s a breakdown of the average costs of the most commonly used building materials:
Recycled bricks:
 You can expect to pay on average between 
35p – £2.00 per reclaimed brick
 plus VAT.
Recycled tiles: 
Tiles come in many materials, shapes and sizes, but typically you’ll pay between 
40p – £1.20 per tile
 plus VAT, depending on its rarity, condition and craftsmanship.
Recycled doors: 
Again, there are so many designs and types when it comes to reclaimed doors, but expect to pay from 
£120
 plus VAT for a period wooden internal door, up to 
£1,000 or more
 plus VAT for a traditional glazed front door.
Recycled flooring:
 If you’re wanting to use reclaimed floorboards or parquet on your project, then you should set aside on average between 
£25 per m2 – £55 per m2
.
For practical suggestions on how to cut the cost of your construction project, check out our guide on  how to save money when building a house . Where to find reclaimed building materials Reclamation yards are always a good bet, as well as demolition companies, but be sure to call ahead with both of these as they’re not always open to the public.
Auction houses are also a good source of reclaimed building materials, particularly with items like chimney pots or garden ornaments to top walls. Beyond this, try online auction sites, but be aware that unless the seller is local, getting hold of your recycled building materials can be difficult and expensive.
Another way is to speak to your local builder. They may have some sustainable building materials that they can use for your project or are able to source for you. Simply enter your postcode below to find builders recommended by your neighbours. What are the best ways to save money when building a house? Building your own home is a dream for many people but there’s no denying it can be an expensive process. To help you stick to your budget, we’ve put together a guide on  saving money when building a house . Read our top tips for cutting costs including shopping around and keeping things simple.

Find your local builder today  FAQs What is a reclamation yard?
Reclamation yards are scattered throughout the UK and are great places to find recycled building materials. Unwanted materials and other items are brought to reclamation yards to be reused or resold. You may find anything from wood to concrete and metal at a reclamation yard. You can also find other items like doors and flooring. What are reclaimed building materials? The term reclaimed building materials refers to materials that have been previously used in construction and are now suitable for reuse. Choosing these materials is a great way of owning a piece of history and saving on the cost of new materials. You may find reclaimed wood, reclaimed bricks and reclaimed timber in your search.
Is building using recycled materials safe?
It’s always recommended that you buy reclaimed building materials from a specialist supplier, this way you can be sure of the quality and safety of the product. You should expect to see weathering and some damage on bricks, tiles and doors etc, but remember these materials would’ve probably lasted another 100 years in the building they were originally part of.
Are used building materials easy to use when building?
Apart from existing holes in tiles bricks and doors, or wear on floorboards, there are few complications to using reclaimed building materials. Just be aware that sizes may not be standard, but that just adds to the unique look!
Do I get the same quality guarantee with used building materials?
It’s unlikely a reclaimed building materials supplier, reclamation yard or auction house will give you the same guarantee as a modern manufacturer who is producing and testing their products en masse. That said, they may offer a limited warranty, so it’s always good to ask before buying.

Landlord garden responsibilities explained,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/landlord-garden-responsibilities/,Garden,"Landlord garden responsibilities explained

In This Blog: What are a landlord’s garden responsibilities? What is covered by landlord garden maintenance?  Disputing landlord or tenant garden maintenance FAQs Understanding landlord garden responsibilities, and outlining this with tenants from the offset, will help to avoid any unnecessary disputes further down the line.
For this reason, the expectations for landlord garden maintenance are usually set out in the tenancy agreement. What are a landlord’s garden responsibilities? In general, a landlord is responsible for making necessary repairs to the rental property, and a tenant is responsible for maintaining it. The garden is no different.
Landlord garden responsibilities will normally require the landlord to maintain the areas of the garden that would be unreasonable for the tenant to do themselves. For example, performing tasks that require specialist skills, such as  tree trimming .
Gardening jobs typically classed as the landlord’s responsibility include: 
Hedge trimming
Tree maintenance
Pruning shrubs
Tenants are often expected to maintain the appearance of the property’s garden. Consider garden maintenance as those jobs that need to be done regularly. A tenant’s garden responsibilities therefore often include:
Cleaning Lawn mowing Weeding
Sweeping surfaces
The landlord should outline to the tenant how they’re expected to maintain the garden or outdoor space. This will be part of the condition of the tenancy.
What is covered by landlord garden maintenance? 
As with the property itself, the garden should be maintained so it’s in the same condition at the end of the rental period as it was at the start.
It’s unreasonable for a landlord to expect a tenant to carry out improvements to a garden if it was in a mess from the start.
Some garden responsibilities will fall to the landlord, as outlined above (trees, hedges, shrubs, etc.), but general upkeep (sweeping, cleaning, and lawn mowing) will be down to the tenant.
If a tree has fallen in the rental property garden, it’s the landlord’s responsibility to have it removed, as long as the damage was not caused by the tenant.
Where a landlord has included specific garden maintenance jobs for the tenant in the tenancy agreement, they should provide the necessary tools or equipment for this. The landlord should also make sure an RCD-protected electrical supply (an electrical supply with a circuit breaker to prevent electrocution) is in place, and provide safety gloves.
In some cases, a landlord will  employ a gardener  to maintain the garden on a regular basis. Again, dependent on the terms of the tenancy agreement, a landlord may pay the lion’s share of this cost, or they may include this cost in the monthly rent (if previously agreed). Disputing landlord or tenant garden maintenance These are our top tips to help avoid disputes over landlord or tenant garden maintenance:
Clearly outline the expectations for garden maintenance in the tenancy agreement.
Take photos of the garden during the property inventory check at the start of the rental. Date these photos for future comparison.
Take a sensible deposit from the tenant at the start of the tenancy to cover any costs that might occur due to damage or neglect by the tenant.
Ensure regular landlord checks to make sure the garden is being maintained as per the tenancy agreement.
As a landlord, make sure adequate buildings insurance is in place to cover any accidental and malicious damage by tenants and their guests.
A longer-term rental often works out better if the property has a garden, as the tenant is more likely to have a vested interest in maintaining the outdoor space for their own enjoyment.
For peace of mind that the garden in your rental property is being well-maintained, search for a local gardener who can take on this responsibility for you.

Find a gardener your neighbours recommend  FAQs Does a landlord have to provide gardening tools?
If the tenancy agreement outlines certain gardening responsibilities for the tenant, the landlord should provide the gardening tools or equipment in order for the tenant to complete these jobs. For example, if it’s the tenant’s responsibility to mow the lawn, the landlord should provide mowing equipment.
Do tenants have to pay for garden maintenance?
If a gardener is employed by the landlord to maintain their rental property, the cost can be applied to a tenant’s rent if they’ve previously agreed to this.
Can a landlord claim for gardening?
Around  16% of Tenancy Deposit Scheme Insured disputes are centred around gardens and their maintenance . If the responsibilities for garden maintenance, as set out in the tenancy agreement, aren’t met, it’s possible for the landlord to impose fines. Without a tenancy agreement garden maintenance clause written, a landlord is unable to make a claim for garden maintenance should an issue arise.
Can you garden in a rental?
A tenant is not allowed to alter or change the landscaping of a rental property without the landlord’s permission. It’s a legal requirement for the tenant to gain the landlord’s approval before changing the garden in any way, even to make improvements. Failure to do so could allow the landlord to charge the tenant the cost of returning the garden to its original state.
Can my landlord tell me to cut the grass?
If the tenant has signed a tenancy agreement that stipulates the tenant is responsible for garden maintenance, a landlord can tell a tenant to cut the grass. A landlord should provide the mowing equipment in order to do this, but mowing the lawn is considered a garden maintenance job, the responsibility for which sits with the tenant.
What does garden maintenance include?
Garden maintenance generally refers to the appearance of the garden and refers to tasks that should be done regularly. Typically, this includes cleaning, lawn mowing, weeding, and sweeping surfaces.

How to start a glass glazier business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-start-a-glass-glazier-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a glass glazier business

Glass and glazing trades offer an important service for both commercial businesses and homeowners, making it great industry to get into if you’re thinking of starting up a new business. Some contractors specialise in large flagship builds, but most earn a profitable livelihood by offering their services to smaller builds, residential properties and other ad-hoc work.
In short, this sector offers excellent opportunities for those aspiring to go self-employed. This guide covers off everything you need to know for how to start up a glass glazing business – from the tools and skills needed, to business planning and marketing.
What does a glass glazier do? 
Glass glaziers fit, install and repair the glass found in windows and doors. They work across different builds, including both commercial and residential properties, though often specialise in one area. Glaziers will usually refer to blueprints to figure out the size and shape of glass they’re working with, and will cut, install and remove material where necessary.
They might also be trained in manufacturing glazed units. As a local glazier, you are paid for choosing the right replacement glass, removing any old or broken pieces, preparing frames, fitting new glass and making it watertight for customers.
How to become a glass glazier 
There is no set path when setting up a glass glazier business but there are a few common routes for entering the trade. Formal qualifications aren’t essential but you’ll definitely need some experience before you can build up a client list.
If you’re completely new to the trade, you should look into gaining on-site experience through a glazing apprenticeship such as intermediate level glazing, construction or fenestration installation. Alternatively, you could look for entry-level jobs with experienced installers and work your way up until you’re comfortable going it alone.
If you already have some experience and just want to demonstrate to customers, you’re competent, it’s worth studying for a Level 2 NVQ certificate in glazing or looking into courses provided by recognised trade bodies like the  UK Glass and Glazing  Federation. You’ll need to pay for this, but it will be a great way to show you’re serious and follow best practice.
Skills
You’ll need a mix of technical skills and some business basics to get your company off the ground. Here is a list of some of the most important skills you’ll need for the glass glazing sector:
Customer service– You’ll need to have strong interpersonal skills to be able to build good relationships with your clients and communicate effectively to meet their expectations
Basic maths – You’ll need to be familiar with how to work out fitting size measurements as a regular part of the job
Fitness – This sector is physically demanding so you’ll need to be in good health to be able to take on difficult jobs
Attention to detail – Glass glazing is all about getting it right down to the last square metre, so you’ll need to be very focused and spot errors before it’s too late
Skilled tradespeople get your business started 
Join Checkatrade today  Join Now Tools
Measuring, cutting, removing, finishing – glaziers do all of these on a daily basis. As such, you’ll need to buy some high-quality tools to do the job properly. Here’s a list of the essentials:
Gloves
Glazier Hammer
Tape Measure
Glass Gun
Putty Knife
Block Lever
Window Scraper
Sealant of Caulk Gun
Glass Cutter
Suction Cups
Circular Glass Cutter
Glass Drill Bit
Suction Lifter
Glass Snips
Utility Knife
Needle Nose Pliers
Pry Bar
Hex Keys
Humidity and Temperature Sensor
Safety Glasses – very important to prevent accidents
As a glazier, you should always carry a full first aid kit. Protective clothing and safety shoes are also recommended. If you’re employing a small team, make sure you’ve also got all the right PPE that’s needed to trade safely and minimise hazards.
Starting your glass glazier business
One of the first things you’ll need to decide is what types of services you’ll offer. With glass glazing, there’s a wide range you can choose from, including specialisms like emergency call-outs. Some options include:
Disposal and repairs
Commercial fitting, such as shop windows and offices
Domestic fitting, including greenhouses and other outdoor buildings
Roof and sky light fitting
Don’t forget there’s also many different types of glass to consider, including single, double and utility glazing. Make sure your training and skills match up with these areas – you don’t want to take on a job where your skills aren’t properly matched.
Standing out from competitors
Most glazing companies carry out replacement and installation, but those looking to specialise could focus on a specific sector like hotels or shops. Restoration work for listed buildings, churches and historical structures could be another avenue worth looking into if you’re searching for something a little different. Remember you’ll need to make sure there’s enough work in your local area, so research before settling on any niche.
Glazier businesses that offer an emergency service will get great word-of-mouth referrals and are easy to market. Clients also may want to work with greener construction methods in the near future, so specialising in this area could be a great asset which marks you out.

Registering your glass glazier business 
Deciding whether to register your business as a sole trader or limited company can be a tricky choice. Consider the long-term plan and whether you’ll be employing a team of tradespeople to help you as this will make the decision easier.
Limited companies will offer greater legal and financial security, so this will work out better if you plan on growing a team with lots of retained contracts. If you want to build a strong reputation as an independent trader relying on local ad-hoc business, registering as a sole trader will likely be a better choice. For a full breakdown, read our guide  here .
Business plan 
Once you’ve settled on registration, it’s time to put together a business plan. Doing your homework will help you to assess the kind of start-up and ongoing costs you’re going to be faced with. The services you decide to offer will also shape your customer base and how you market to them. Key points to cover in your plan include:
Short, mid- and long-term goals
Target market and volume of customers in different areas
Competitors
Opportunities for growth
Demand for specialist services
Ingoings and outgoings, including taxes
Yearly projections
Recruitment
There’s a lot of paperwork when starting a new business and some of this might be unfamiliar to you. Taxes are especially important to get right as you can be fined for improper filing. If you’re unsure about what you need to do, you could always hire an accountant to help – read more about that  here .
Pricing
Look at what competitors are charging for their services and match yours up against them. Your prices should always reflect the type of service you offer and how long it will take to complete. You will also need to factor in technical aspects that might prolong the job. For example, you should charge a higher premium rate for large, difficult installation work on listed buildings.
Most glass glaziers will charge for installation work on an hourly or daily basis, adding the cost of any materials bought to the grand total. While you want your prices to be attractive to new customers, don’t go too low as you may be eating into your profit margins. Business loans can help if you’re worried about cashflow in the early days – just remember to read the terms carefully and make repayments on time.
Marketing to homeowners
Focus on building good relationships with clients and ensure the business’s name is spread word-of-mouth in your local area. Securing an advertisement in a newspaper is an effective way to get started, as it will raise awareness in nearby neighbourhoods and get the ball rolling. Social media can also be used with local hashtags and targeted ads to get in front of homeowners that are actively looking for services like yours.
Once you’ve done a good job on a few homes, people will likely share your good work with neighbours and friends who are also in need of glazing or other glass services. If this creates a steady pipeline of work, you can always dial back on your digital spending.
Don’t forget about door-to-door leaflets and vehicle graphics either – these always drum up new business and get your name out there without too much effort. Just keep an eye out for junk mail notices as it will irritate homeowners if you ignore them.
Marketing to other businesses
Often the first thing businesses do when looking for a tradesperson is check online directories and reviews. That’s why a  Checkatrade membership  is vital for those starting up a new business. Upon joining, your business will be visible to over three million monthly site users who could become your customers. Not only does membership raise your online profile, but also lets you showcase images of your finest work and display customer recommendations to enhance your reputation.
You could also contact local residential landlord associations to enquire about being included in their supplier’s guide – this is especially important if you’re looking for the bigger contracts on new-build sites. Remember networking events are also useful ways to get in front of the people that matter. Have informal chats with decision-makers – you can always leave them a business card and take the conversation further if they show interest.
Insurance for your glass glazier business
Glass is a delicate material and accidents can always happen, so make sure you’re covered should the worst happen.
Glazier’s insurance will be a top priority – You will only pay for what you need and many companies provide quotes for trades, shop around for the best price
Tools, plant and machinery insurance – This will cover replacement costs should your equipment be stolen, damaged or lost Public liability insurance  – Most professional glaziers will get this insurance to cover costs for any accidents and injuries Employers’ liability cover  – This insurance is essential to cover claims from employees or contractors you hire
FAQs
How much can I earn as a self-employed glass glazier?
The average annual salary for a glazier is roughly £32,500 per year in the UK. But you could earn far more than this if your business is successful.
What is the hourly rate for glass glazier businesses?
In the UK, the average glazier hourly pay is between £8-£16, but this will depend largely on what the job consists of. Complexity, materials supplied, replacements and repairs will all be factors which affect what you charge
Is glass glazing a profitable business?
You can be sure that glass glazing isn’t going out of business any time soon, so there will always be a market for you. What you take home will also grow as you become more established and are able to branch out and offer more specialist services.

Building near trees: All you need to know,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/building-near-trees/,Tag Not Found,"Building near trees: All you need to know

One of the best things about living in the UK is the abundance of nature everywhere you go. When it comes to building however, trees can either be considered a valued asset or a huge inconvenience. While they offer shelter and environmental benefits, they can have an effect on any nearby structures.
So, if you come across a job where trees are an issue, this guide on building near trees is perfect for you. After reading this article, you’ll know all about the risk of building near trees. We’ll also be looking at building near trees with preservation orders, building regulations for foundations, and how close to a tree you can safely build.
Building near trees – Integrity and foundations
Most homeowners appreciate some greenery in their gardens and trees are a great choice. However, as a tradesperson you’ll find trees can be a real hinderance to your projects.
In fact, building near trees can have a serious effect on the structural integrity of a home. This is due to the roots of the tree sucking moisture from the soil under or near to the building. This causes the earth to shrink and the foundations to shift.
To further complicate things, different sizes and types of tree will have differing effects on a structure so it’s important to consider this during your planning. Generally, clay soil is the most affected soil when it comes to building near trees, so you’ll need to ensure the foundations are deeper to counteract this.
Building near trees with preservation orders
Tree preservation orders or TPOs control whether or not you can cut down a tree. Any type of tree can be protected so you’ll need to check with your local authority before cutting down any unwanted trees. Please note, if you’re working within a conservation area then all trees will be protected and you’ll need to check with your local authority before making any changes.
You should always ensure you make a planning application when building a structure, that includes whether any trees will be impacted by your plans. You can then check whether any trees are under a TPO. Remember, cutting down a protected tree is a criminal offence with fines of up to £2,000.
This all means that building near protected trees can be a real issue. So, what happens if there’s a tree near where you plan to build but it’s covered by a TPO? Well, luckily your local authority has the ability to revoke a TPO so they should be your first port of call.
NHBC standards chapter 4.2 guidance for building near trees
Chapter 4.2 of the NHBC standards covers guidance on building near trees and focuses on how foundations are affected by trees. It’s a handy document to read and refer to if you’re unsure how to work with a tree adjacent to where you plan to build. It also covers areas like soils, drainage, and heave precautions. You can find more information on the  NHBC standards website. Feeling a little confused? Why not consider

Building regulations for foundations near trees
As we mentioned previously, you’ll need to dig deeper foundations for certain trees that are close to where you plan to build. Foundation depth near trees is varied depending on how far away the tree is, the type of tree, the height of the tree and the soil type.
Building regulations for foundations near trees are also in place stating that foundations should be at least 900mm before you even take into account the effects of a tree. If you’re unsure how deep to dig foundations for your latest job, you can use an online building near trees calculator. Just enter a few details into the  online form  at LAPC warranty for quick results.
Building near different types of trees
Each type of tree will have a different root system to keep it supported and fed as it grows. This means you’ll need to adapt your building process depending on the type of tree you plan to build next to. When it comes to building near conifer trees and building near oak trees, both species can cause issues with foundations and if their roots are affected by your job, the trees will die.
Building walls near trees
Similar to the impact of trees on buildings and visa versa, building walls near trees can also cause issues. It’s never a good idea to build a wall over tree roots as the chances are that wall will become unstable and crack over time.
On the other hand, if you cut the tree’s roots, this could impact the health of the tree and cause it to die. As a general rule, it’s recommended that you build your wall at least the same distance away as the height of the tree. For example, if the tree is 10 foot tall, you should build the wall at least 10 foot away.

If you’re looking into starting your own construction company,  joining Checkatrade  is the perfect way to hit the ground running. With free marketing materials and access to millions of homeowners looking to hire a Checkatrade member, your new business will get an amazing start.

How close can you build to a tree?
This really depends on the height and type of tree, but ensure that you build at least the same distance away as the height of the tree.
Can you build an extension near a tree?
You can to a certain extent. If you build your extension too close to a tree, the extension and tree will be at risk.
Can you build under trees?
It’s not recommended as this can affect both the building and the tree.
Do trees affect foundations?
Yes, the tree’s roots can suck the moisture out from the soil under foundations, affecting their stability.
Useful checklist for building near trees
Before starting any construction project, consider the effect of any nearby trees.
Without sufficient distance, tree roots can cause buildings to become structurally unstable and buildings can cause trees to wither and die.
You should check with your local authority to see if a tree is covered by a TPO before you cut it down.
It’s a criminal offence to cut down a tree that’s protected under a TPO.
If you do need to build near a tree, it’s important to dig foundations deep enough to ensure your structure is as stable as possible.

How to stay under the VAT threshold,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/stay-under-vat-threshold/,Tag Not Found,"How to stay under the VAT threshold

VAT is something most tradespeople are aware of, and whether to become VAT registered is a key consideration for every business. In fact, in order to run a successful company, you’ll need to know your responsibilities when it comes to paying and charging VAT. Luckily, you may be able to avoid becoming VAT registered by learning how to stay under the VAT threshold.
This article covers vital issues like what happens if you go slightly over the VAT threshold, whether being VAT registered is the right choice for your business, and how to split your business to avoid VAT. So read on for everything you need to know about staying under the VAT threshold.
How to stay under VAT threshold
Ok, before we dive into how to stay under the VAT threshold, let’s take a closer look at what VAT is. VAT stands for Value Added Tax and is added when goods or services are sold in the UK. You’ll usually pay VAT when buying from your favourite store or you may need to add VAT to the cost of your services.
Knowing whether you need to register to pay VAT depends on your business turnover in the last 12 months. The VAT threshold is set at £85,000 so if your turnover exceeds this amount, you’ll need to become VAT registered.
There are a few ways to stay under the VAT threshold, one of which involves splitting your business to avoid VAT. You can break your company down into two or more separate businesses, but each part of your company needs to offer different services to make the distinction clear. You should also consider having separate bank accounts and you’ll need to complete two or more tax returns.
How to avoid paying VAT as a business
Knowing how to avoid paying VAT as a business can be handy when it comes to keeping prices for your services competitive. When you become VAT registered you won’t pay the VAT yourself, your customers will pay this instead, meaning you need to charge more. If you do need to charge VAT, this money will actually go to the government, you’ll just collect it on their behalf.
In addition, you can reclaim any VAT your business has paid on expenses over the same time period.
You can avoid paying VAT by making sure your business earns less than the £85,000 threshold. Other ways to prevent your company from paying VAT are to avoid getting your customers to purchase materials themselves, not taking large one-off payments, and operating on fewer days a week.
Going temporarily over the VAT threshold
If your business goes temporarily over the VAT threshold you may be able to ask the HMRC for an exception. Ensure this is submitted in writing less than 30 days after you go over the £85,000 threshold.
If you’re concerned going over the VAT threshold will affect your business,  joining Checkatrade  is a fantastic way to offset this. With our buyers club you can make huge savings on business essentials, and you can get support and advice through our members community.

Yes, you can register to pay VAT before your turnover exceeds £85,000 as a precaution. If your company doesn’t pass the threshold, you can also de-register from paying VAT.
Should I stay under the VAT threshold?
This is a great question, and many tradespeople wonder if it is better to be VAT registered or not. There are both advantages and disadvantages to staying under the VAT threshold, as shown below:
Disadvantages:
 You’ll need to fill out more paperwork, your customers may not be happy to pay higher prices and your cashflow may be affected.
Advantages:
 You get to reclaim any VAT you have paid to other companies and your business will appear more credible to customers.
If you’re unsure about whether or not to register for VAT, we have an excellent guide covering the different considerations. Check out our  should I become VAT registered  guide to learn more.

Do you pay VAT on profit or turnover?
VAT is charged on your company’s turnover, not profits.
Useful checklist for how to stay under the VAT threshold
The VAT threshold is £85,000 and if your company turnover exceeds this, you’ll need to register to pay VAT.
You can stay under the VAT threshold by splitting your business, working less days, or not taking big one-off payments.
If you go temporarily over the VAT threshold you may be able to apply for an exception.

Do I need planning permission for an extension?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/planning-permission-extension/,"Garage, Kitchen","Do I need planning permission for an extension?

In This Blog: Planning permission for an extension Planning permission for a single-storey extension Planning permission for a kitchen extension Planning permission for a garage extension Planning permission for a two-storey extension Cost of planning permission for an extension What to do if you have no planning permission for your extension? FAQs The thought of extending your home is an exciting prospect, but before you start choosing paint colours and finishes, you must first find out what planning permission you will need.
If you start your build without the necessary planning permission, you could face an enforcement notice. In a worst-case scenario, this can result in you having to take the whole building down.
Planning permission is not needed for every extension, but it’s important to check the rules before you start your build to save potential upheaval further down the line.
To make things simple, we’ve outlined the planning permission requirements for some of the most popular extensions, including:
Single-storey extensions
Two-storey extensions
Kitchen extensions
Garage extensions
We’ll also explain when you don’t need permission and what the cost of planning permission for an extension is, to help you budget for this part of the project. Planning permission for an extension If you build within your permitted development rights, you don’t need planning permission.
Permitted development rights allow a homeowner to make alterations to their property quickly, without having to apply for planning permission. However, within permitted development, you must make sure that specific limitations and conditions are met.
Our  permitted development rights  guide will take you through the updated Government legislation, as of September 2020. This clearly explains what permissions are granted for different types of property, and the restrictions to be aware of.
For any sort of extension, we recommend you  contact your local planning authority (LPA) , to check planning requirements before work begins.

Find your local home extension builder today  Planning permission for a single-storey extension You will not need planning permission for a single-storey extension if it falls within permitted development rights, providing certain limitations and conditions are met.
The recently relaxed permitted development rules mean that you can build an extension without planning permission of up to six metres (or eight metres if your house is detached). The extension cannot be more than four metres high. If the extension is within two metres of the property’s boundary, the extension can’t be more than three metres high.
We advise you to  speak with a professional , such as an architect or designer, before undertaking any work. Planning permission for a kitchen extension The good news is, you do not need planning permission for a kitchen extension, providing you meet the conditions and limitations of permitted development, as outlined above. Planning permission for a garage extension You will not need planning permission for a garage providing you stay within certain parameters:
The garage must not be used as a living space.
For a freestanding garage, it must be less than 15 m2.
For an attached garage, the floor must be less than 30 m2. The materials used to build the garage must be non-flammable, and be at least 1m from any property boundaries. Planning permission for a two-storey extension There are 
permitted development rights for a two-storey rear extension to a house
, meaning you will not need planning permission. However, you will need to make sure your extension adheres to certain conditions and limitations:
The eaves and pitch heights must not exceed that of the existing house. If the building is within two metres of a boundary, the maximum height of the eaves is limited to three metres.
You can extend up to three metres from the original house, but it must be more than seven metres from the rear boundary. An extension, shed or outbuilding should not exceed more than 50% of the total plot.
The materials should have a similar aesthetic to the original house.
Verandas or  balconies  are not allowed without planning permission. If your plans include an upper floor window in a side elevation, it must be obscured glazing and non-opening (unless it’s more than 1.7m from floor level internally). 
You will need planning permission for a two-storey extension if it’s to the side or front of the original house
. And there are a number of considerations that will determine whether your application is granted or refused. This detail can be found in our post on the  cost of a double-storey extension .
Flats and maisonettes do not have permitted development rights. And properties that have undergone a change of use in the past may not have permitted development rights either.
It’s a good idea to instruct an  architect  for this type of extension. Their expertise will help to ensure your plans make the best use of the space available. Cost of planning permission for an extension 
Your first port of call when planning an extension should be your local planning office. They will be able to tell you:
Whether you need planning permission for your extension
The type of planning permission you need
The cost of your application
Take a look at our guide on  the cost of planning permission  to see the different types of planning permission (full planning permission, outline planning permission, and householder planning permission), and their costs. The post also outlines the differing costs depending on your location (England, Scotland or Wales).
As a quick guide:
Full planning permission is 
£206 (England) 
and 
£202 (Wales)
. This is for alterations/extensions to a single dwelling house or flat.
Outline planning permission is 
£426 (England), £460 (Wales), 
and
 £401 (Scotland)
. These costs are per 0.1 hectares of land (up to 2.5 hectares).
Householder permission is 
£206 (England), £230 (Wales), 
and
 £202 (Scotland)
. These costs relate to alterations/extensions to a single dwelling house. This permission is not applicable to flats or altering the number of dwellings. What to do if you have no planning permission for your extension? If you have no planning permission for your extension, you can apply retrospectively.
Retrospective planning permission is subject to the same criteria as a standard planning application and won’t automatically be granted. Your plans could be refused. If your application is rejected, you will be required to put things back to how they were unless you appeal the decision and it’s overturned. This is done through your local planning authority.
Retrospective planning permission costs are the same as those for advance permission (as outlined above).

Find your local home extension builder today  FAQs How can I apply for planning permission for an extension?
To apply for planning permission for an extension, contact your local planning authority (LPA) through your local council.
How much is planning permission for an extension?
The cost depends on where you live and the type of planning permission you’re applying for.
In England, full planning permission costs 
£206
. Outline planning permission is 
£426
 and householder permission is 
£206
. See our post on the  cost of planning permission  for a full breakdown of costs.
When do you need planning permission for an extension?
Generally, you need planning permission if you want to:
Build something new
Make a major change to your building, such as an extension
Change the use of your building
If your extension falls within permitted development rights, you will not need planning permission.
To be sure, you should always  check with your local planning authority (LPA)  before you commence any work.
Do you need planning permission for a small extension?
Homeowners are permitted to build an extension of up to six metres without planning permission. For a detached house, the limit is eight metres.
What is lawful development?
Lawful development is development against which no enforcement action may be taken and where no enforcement notice is in force, or, for which planning permission is not required. It’s not a legal requirement to have a  lawful development certificate , but it’s worthwhile getting one. It’ll prove to the local authority and any future buyers that your build was legal at the point of construction.

But, what if you could ask all your neighbours in one go instantly? That’s what our  free search engine  lets you do. You can see all past reviews and pictures from the people who live near you. What to look for in the best driveway paver Although many general builders are able to lay gravel or basic driveways, to get an amazing finish we’d recommend hiring a specialist driveway paver. After all, every tradesperson will have a range of skills and qualities that make them a good choice for a range of different jobs.
When searching for the perfect paver for your project look for someone who’s:
Trustworthy
Committed
Hard-working
Experienced
Friendly
Qualified
Open to questions
Knowledgeable
Professional
Honest
The best way to assess whether a professional has these qualities is to take a little time to chat with them and ask for past customer reviews.

Questions to ask when hiring a driveway paver When deciding whether or not to hire a driveway paver we’d suggest you invite them round for a quote and then ask them some basic questions. They should be happy to address your concerns and queries. If they brush you off or don’t give proper answers, they may not be the best tradesperson to work on your driveway.
It’s really important that you make a list of questions to ask before you speak to your paver to ensure you don’t forget anything. Unsure what to ask? Then use the below questions:
Can I have the quote in writing?
Does the total cost of my driveway include VAT?
Do you have insurance?
Can I see examples of your past work?
What is the rough timescale?
Do you offer a guarantee?
When will you begin working on my driveway?
How much experience do you have?
Can I see past customer reviews or testimonials? Warning signs to look out for when hiring a driveway paver While many of the tradespeople you speak to are hardworking and trustworthy, there’s still a chance you might accidentally hire a rogue trader. To avoid this, there are a few warning signs you can look out for to help you find the best driveway paver.
The following are red flags:
Asking for full payment before the work begins
Any tradesperson who comes knocking on your door and asking for work
Lots of negative customer reviews
The tradesperson doesn’t answer your questions
They refuse to show you any examples of past work
Poor recommendations from family or friends
The paver has no insurance

Can you paint over wallpaper?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/paint-over-wallpaper/,"Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Can you paint over wallpaper?

In This Blog: Important considerations before painting over wallpaper Painting over vinyl wallpaper Painting over textured wallpaper Painting over wallpaper glue What should I do? FAQs Painting your home can completely change your living space and is one of the easiest and best ways to switch up your interior style, especially if you’re on a tighter budget. But what if you’ve got wallpaper there that you’d like to change up? Many people wonder if you can paint over wallpaper to save time and energy because removing wallpaper is tricky, time-consuming and can cause damage to your walls.
In some cases this is possible, however, certain types of wallpaper make this an impossible task, especially if you want to get a beautiful finish. For this reason, painting over wallpaper generally isn’t recommended.
Read on for more information and tips on how to make your home look great. Important considerations before painting over wallpaper Before you decide whether or not painting over wallpaper is the right choice, there are a few things to consider. The most important consideration is the condition of your wallpaper. Old, peeling or torn wallpaper doesn’t make an even base for paint, leading to terrible results.
Also, think about how old your home is. Removing wallpaper can cause plaster and parts of the wall to crack, and the older the wall, the worse it will be. With this in mind, you may choose to paint over it in order to prevent these issues in the short term.
If you’re unsure about what to do, we recommend contacting a professional  painter/decorator  to get their advice.
If you’re thinking of painting yourself and have got everything prepped, check out our  how to paint a room guide . Painting over vinyl wallpaper When it comes to painting over vinyl wallpaper, you’ll need to use the right preparation methods to achieve great results. We’d recommend thoroughly cleaning the wallpaper before beginning and treating any mould at the same time. You’ll also need to use a primer or undercoat to help the paint settle over the wallpaper before painting. We’d suggest using Zissner Wallpaper Cover Up. Painting over textured wallpaper While it’s possible to paint over textured wallpaper, this is definitely not advised. The texture of the wallpaper will usually show through the paint, affecting the appearance of your walls. You always have the option of covering your old wallpaper with plaster, but this is a difficult job to do well unless you have experience in this area. In fact, skimming may be trickier than wallpaper removal. Painting over wallpaper glue Even after removing wallpaper, you may find your walls are still covered with wallpaper glue. Painting over this is not a good idea either, as your finished walls will appear bumpy and clumpy when the paint mixes with the glue. What should I do? While painting over wallpaper is possible, it’s generally not advised and the finished results tend to vary from job to job. If you want stunning, flawless walls, your best option is to hire a professional to remove your wallpaper and paint the walls from scratch.
Finding a tradesperson is easy, simply search  here  and have a look at the profiles of the tradespeople near you. You can be confident in the knowledge that all of our members go through 12 checks before becoming a Checkatrade member. You can also see all their previous reviews so you can see who your neighbours have recommended.

Find a painter trusted by your neighbours  FAQs Can you paint over lining paper?
Yes, you can paint over lining paper. In fact, lining paper makes an excellent base for wallpapering or painting. It covers small cracks and bumps, making a uniform surface that’s perfect if you plan to paint your walls.
Can you paint over patterned wallpaper?
Patterned wallpaper can create a beautiful effect in any home, however if this isn’t to your taste, it may be tempting to simply paint over the top. It’s possible to paint over patterned wallpaper, although you need to be prepared for the pattern to show through the paint. We’d suggest using a primer or undercoat to best cover the pattern.
How much does professional painting cost?
Utilising the skills of a professional painter is a great way of getting beautifully finished walls, however this will come at a cost. Thankfully, hiring a decorator is quite reasonable with an average cost of £190 per day. To help you plan your project, all the prices, factors and information you need is covered in our  painter/decorator cost guide.

How to start a gutter cleaning business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-start-a-gutter-cleaning-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a gutter cleaning business

Gutter cleaning offers great opportunities for trades looking to set up their own business. It essentially involves removing dirt and debris from the rain gutters of houses so they can flow properly. Although that might sound simple, it can be a tough and dangerous job if not done properly, which is why many would rather pay a professional to do it.
Going self-employed gives you the freedom to choose your own working hours and the types of jobs you decide to take. Once you’re all set up, you can begin growing your business and developing complementary services like new guttering installation for extra revenue. If this appeals to you, read on as we cover everything needed to get your own gutter cleaning business up and running.
Should I have qualifications when starting up a gutter cleaning business?
There aren’t any direct qualifications for gutter cleaning, so on-the-job training or apprenticeships are a good place to start if you have little or no experience. A cleaning driving licence is also desirable as you’ll be transporting materials and tools between jobs.
If you already have some experience but want to show you’re a professional to potential customers, you could consider a business opportunity training day. These courses cover off the basics when setting up a new trade offering and teach best practice across different sectors. There are plenty of courses for gutter cleaning training, so do some research and find one nearby if you’re keen. Just remember you will likely need to pay a small fee to attend.
What skills do I need to start a gutter cleaning business?
You’ll need a range of skills when gutter cleaning but also for running your own business successfully. Here is a list of the essentials:
Physical fitness – You’ll be on your feet most of the day and moving bags of waste
Dexterity – You’ll be working up ladders and reaching across guttering
Health and safety knowledge – crucial as you’ll be working at height most of the time
Time management – You’ll need to work efficiently to get as many homes done while it’s still light outside
Communication skills – For building a good rapport with customers and any team members you’ll employ
What equipment is required for gutter cleaning? 
You need to invest in the right equipment to deliver a professional service and keep customers satisfied. It’s better to pay the one-time fee for good tools rather than having to fork out again later on because cheaper ones have worn out or broken. These are the essentials you’ll need for your gutter cleaning business:
Van or another vehicle for getting around
Leaf blower
Scoop
Extension pole
Refuse bags
Buckets and tarps
Gloves and boots
Safety helmet
You should also invest in protective overalls because gutter cleaning is a dirty job. It’s essential to wear the proper clothing suitable for all weathers – especially colder days. You’ll also need to make a decision on whether you’ll use a traditional ladder or opt for a vacuum-based system that allows you to clear leaves without working at height. If you do go for a traditional ladder, you’ll need to invest in:
Safety ropes
Harnesses
Long extension ladder (24 or 32-feet options are sufficient for most jobs)
Ladder stabiliser
Skilled tradespeople get your business started 
Join Checkatrade today  Join Now How do I start a gutter cleaning business?
Before you head out and start cleaning gutters, familiarise yourself with the laws relevant to the trade. The 2005 Working at Height Regulations imposes strict rules concerning ladder use and safety. It puts liability for accidents on the owner or occupier of a property, which has led to many gutter cleaning companies to invest in ladderless cleaning vacuums. This allows the operator to clean from the ground, bypassing regulations and is often more appealing to customers. In order to compete, it may be necessary to do the same. Starter systems cost around £500.
Registering your business 
Once you decide on an approach, you’ll need to pull together a gutter company business plan. This will involve competitor research, identifying opportunities and setting goals. You’ll also need to register your business with HMRC and decide on a corporate structure. There are two options: sole trader and limited company.
Registering your business as a limited company will offer greater legal and financial security. So, if you’re wanting to grow your business and number of employees, this option may be more appealing to you. But if you are seeking to establish a strong reputation as an independent trader built on personal expertise, registering as a sole trader will be more appropriate. There are pros and cons for both options – for more, read our guide  here .
Bear in mind that since gutter cleaning is a seasonal business, with peaks from late autumn through winter, you’ll need to be prepared to work very long hours to maximise profits. Finally, don’t forget to choose on a catchy name for your new enterprise – research gutter cleaning business names in your local area and try to settle on something that stands out from the crowd.
Pricing
Your business plan should also consider start-up and ongoing costs. Working out which services you offer will be directly linked to the pricing strategies you adopt. For example, investing in leaderless equipment as opposed to offering a by-hand service will incur substantially higher upfront costs and may require training so you can use it safely. Check what competitors are charging and then set your prices accordingly. Just remember most customers look for a fixed price option rather than a ‘per metre’ approach.
Marketing 
Now you have chosen your services and pricing strategies, it’s time to consider who your target market is. The majority of your customers will either be homeowners or commercial properties in need of gutter clearing. How you pitch your business to these groups will vary, so consider if there’s more opportunity for one or the other in your local area.
Digital marketing is key for today’s trades. Among customers, eight out of ten are aware of Checkatrade, so  becoming a member  means you’re guaranteed to expand your online reach and help you come across as a credible business. Not to mention you can benefit from member discounts on business essentials including tools, fuel and insurance. This will be especially useful when covering the start-up costs for your business.
Print is also good for targeting local areas. with a few hundred flyers printed and distributed around your local area. Just remember to check for signs saying no cold calling. Don’t forget word-of-mouth recommendations either – encourage your existing clients to spread the word by offering discounts for referrals.
Insurance 
Gutter cleaning can be dangerous work and accidents can always happen, so make sure you’re covered should the worst occur. Public liability insurance  – If your customers are mostly homeowners, this insurance policy is essential. It will protect you from the cost of compensation for personal injuries, as well as loss or damage done to a customer’s property
Workers compensation insurance – Important if you’re employing a small team of colleagues to help you complete jobs
Tools insurance – This will cover replacements costs for any equipment that’s lost or stolen
Professional indemnity insurance – You’ll always aim to do a good job and it’s unlikely anything drastic will happen but there’s no guarantee customers will be happy with the work. This insurance will protect you from these types of claims
How can I grow a gutter cleaning business?
Starting a business is hard work and can feel daunting, but it’s also incredibly fulfilling. Gutter cleaning set up might also sound like a difficult task but doesn’t have to be. Marketing and advertisements in the right places, for example, will soon get the ball rolling.
Once you’re established, you could also develop a specialist service to help you stand out from the crowd. For example, offering to make minor gutter repairs while working, or offering some gutter guards. It’s also not uncommon for gutter cleaners to offer leaf removal, window washing and skylight cleaning services.
An emphasis should always be kept on providing a good quality service and keeping customers happy. You can read more about how another trade did exactly that  here .
FAQs
Is a gutter business profitable?
Gutter business profit margins are generally quite good as there’s few overheads when starting up. You can also generate a decent stream of income during peak months when there’s more debris and leaves about. If you’re efficient and price your services appropriately, you can earn up to £200 a day and sometimes more.
How much should I charge to clean gutters?
How much you decide to charge for cleaning gutters will depend on a few factors. You’ll need to know the height at which you will be working, the type of building and whether there are any hazards that will make the process more difficult and dangerous. As a general rule, most gutter cleaners charge as a fixed rate for the time it takes, with an hourly rate of £18-£25.
Do you need a professional to clean gutters?
Gutter cleaning can be done by homeowners but it’s a job that often gets pushed down the to-do list, despite being important for a properly functioning building. It’s also dangerous, so owners prefer to pay a professional to do it for them.
Can you make money in guttering?
Given the essential nature of guttering, you can be sure that this industry will never go out of demand. A gutter business owner salary can also be quite high, especially when you’ve built up a good portfolio of clients and won over plenty of locals. It’s ultimately down to efficiency and how well you can manage your commitments.

How to start a cat flap fitter business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-start-a-cat-flap-fitter-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a cat flap fitter business

Cat flaps are an important piece of equipment for any pet-loving homeowner, especially if their cat is going to be able to come and go as they please. But installing a cat flap takes a certain degree of skill and know-how that only particular tradespeople possess. Starting a business in cat flap fitting is the perfect way to capitalise on this trade niche. Not to mention you’re bound to receive steady demand from the abundance of cat owners.
Going self-employed can of course be a daunting prospect, which is why this guide will take you through everything you need to know from necessary tools through to marketing strategy. Read on to find out how you can get your cat flap fitter business smoothly up and running.
Will I need qualifications to start a cat flap fitter business?
When starting a business, it’s always important to have some form of credentials you can present to potential customers. Qualifications are a way of demonstrating the professional skills and training you’ve acquired, which will make your service appear more reliable.
Cat flap fitting can involve working with different materials such as glass, wood and brick, so qualifications in carpentry, fenestration or construction will be very useful for attracting clients to your business. This can include:
Level 2 or Level 3 Diploma in Carpentry and Joinery
Site Carpenter apprenticeship
Level 2 NVQ Diploma in Fenestration Installation
Level 1 Certificate in Construction Skills
Level 2 Certificate in Construction Operations
What tools are required for cat flap fitting? 
Having the right tools is essential for providing a top-quality service. You’ll need to make sure you have a full inventory of equipment so you can be fully prepared in every scenario. Not only will you come across as a professional, but it also makes your life easier.
While you may be wary of start-up costs, it’s vital that you invest in high quality tools. Shoddy equipment will only increase the likelihood of you having to fork out for costly replacements and experiencing delays on the job.
Here are the essentials for cat flap fitting:
Drill
Drill bits
Screwdriver
Tape measure
Spirit level
Jigsaw
Pencil
Sandpaper
Keep in mind that you’ll also need a vehicle large enough to transport all your tools between jobs.
What are the most important skills for starting a cat flap fitting business? 
As a self-employed tradesperson, you’ll be faced with challenging scenarios both on the job and in managing your business. That’s why a wide range of skills will be valuable for overcoming these challenges and keeping things running smoothly. Here are the most important attributes you’ll need to succeed:
Numeracy skills for precise fitting measurements and managing your business finances

Join Checkatrade today  Join Now How do I set up a cat flap fitter business? 
There are several areas to take care of when laying the foundations of your business.
Putting a name on it 
First of all, you’ll need to think of a name for your business. Try coming up with one that is short and catchy as this will make your start-up more memorable for potential clients. It’s also a good idea to make the name relevant to your trade so people can quickly recognise the service you’re offering.
Sorting the legal side of things 
Once you’ve come up with a name, the next step is to register your business with HMRC. During this process, you’ll have to come to a decision on how you want to structure your start-up. Sole trading is easier to set up, but keep in mind that you’ll be responsible for any debt or loss your business incurs. A limited company, on the other hand, will take some more legwork to set up and manage, however you’ll benefit from better financial protection.
These are just some of the pros and cons to weigh up when choosing a business structure. You can check out our handy comparison guide  here  to help you decide.
Mapping out your business
Organisation is key to any start-up, which is why you should come up with a thorough business plan that covers the ins and outs of your service. It’s a good idea to base your service around your expertise and experience to ensure your work is of a high standard. This could mean you choose to specialise in certain types of cat flap fittings like microchip, magnetic or infrared mechanisms for example. By doing so, you can establish a niche and benefit from a constant stream of demand for your business.
Making sure the price is right 
Setting the prices of your service will require a bit of thought. You don’t want to charge too much and cause customers to go elsewhere, but you also need to make sure you don’t set your prices too low and end up struggling to make profit.
That’s why it’s best to research the competition and find out what their pay rates look like. This way, you can keep your prices competitive and attract enough business without undercharging. You can also read our cost guide  here  for a general idea of cat flap installation rates.
Protecting yourself and your business
In the rare instance that something goes wrong or a customer is left unhappy with your work, insurance will be vital for protecting you and your business. Here are the main types of insurance you should have in place: Public liability insurance  – Covers legal and compensation fees if a customer claims you’ve damaged their property or caused injury. Professional indemnity insurance  – Provides protection in the event you make a mistake with your work that causes the customer financial loss.
Tools insurance – Covers the cost of replacing your tools if they’re lost or damaged.
How do I manage my finances? 
Staying on top of all your finances will be essential for keeping your business running smoothly.
Managing cashflow 
Cashflow is essentially all the ingoings and outgoings for your business. You’ll need to keep a close eye on these numbers to ensure you’re making profit at the end of the day. As a part of managing your cashflow you might find you have to adjust your expenditure or revenue if you’re not seeing the expected returns. For more advice, check out our guide  here .
Filing taxes 
As well as cashflow, taxes are a major part of your finances that you’ll have to monitor closely. Keep in mind that different structures have different taxes, so you’ll need to understand which taxes apply to your business and document these regularly. If you’re not sure which apply or you’re struggling to keep on top of your taxes, you could hire an accountant to help. For more information on employing accountancy services, read our article  here .
Covering costs 
In the beginning, you may find your operating at a loss due to initial start-up costs. This is perfectly normal, but if you’re worried by the lack of turnover you could consider taking out a business loan to cover the costs while you find your feet. Just bear in mind the interest rates when going down this avenue.
How can I grow a cat flap fitting business? 
To grow your start-up and secure more opportunities, you should look to promote your service. Marketing is a really effective tool when used correctly, so you’ll need to gauge what strategies will be the right course of action for your business.  Signing up to Checkatrade  is bound to open the door to greater opportunities as your business will become accessible to a huge online audience. Not to mention it will enhance your reputation as potential customers recognise the credibility of businesses associated with Checkatrade.
To open up your business further, you should look to build a profile on multiple social media channels. Not only is it a great way to showcase your best work, but you can also interact with other users to expand your client base.
Keep in mind that traditional print marketing is still a useful approach for promoting your business, especially in your local area. You could create posters and strategically place them near pet stores to catch the eye of cat owners that may be in need of your services.

How to start a door fitting business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-start-a-door-fitting-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a door fitting business

Every building needs doors for coming and going between rooms, entrances and exits. Seeing as they are such a necessity, it’s no surprise that door fitting is a service in constant demand. Not just anyone can fit a door correctly either — it’s a specialised skill that’s highly sought after.
With all this in mind, going self-employed as a door fitter is the perfect opportunity to capitalise on a thriving market and also reap the rewards of becoming your own boss. You’ll have complete freedom to choose your working hours, clients and the nuts and bolts of your service. This new level of independence can of course be daunting, which is why this guide will take you through how to set up your own door fitting business and take that next step in your career.
Do I need qualifications to start a door fitting business?
Qualifications are very important when starting a business. Having a solid set of credentials demonstrates to customers that you have gained the professional skills and training required to carry out quality work.
For door fitting in particular, you’ll need at the very least some form of carpentry qualifications to show your expertise in woodwork. It would be a good idea to have also completed Pro-fitter Fenestration Training and Certification to highlight your specific skills in door fitting. This can go a long way in making your business stand out from the competition.
What equipment should I have for door fitting?
Turning up to a job underprepared won’t reflect well on your reputation, so it’s vital that you have a full inventory of tools from the get-go. Approaching your jobs fully equipped helps to avoid delays and slapdash work, making your life a lot easier.
Make sure you invest in high quality equipment too. While you might be looking to keep start-up costs down, poor tools are a sure-fire way to run into problems and end up forking out for costly replacements. Here are the essentials you’ll need for door-fitting:
Screwdrivers
Panel saw
Chisels
Plane
Tape measure
Hammer
Sand paper
Utility knife
Power drill
Don’t forget you’ll also need a van for transporting all your tools between jobs.
What skills are important for door fitting? 
Going self-employed means you’ll face challenges on the job, but also while running your own business. A wide set of skills will be necessary if you’re to overcome these scenarios. Here are the most important qualities to have:
Dexterity for accurate screwing, cutting and planning.
Physical strength for lifting, removing and fitting doors
Basic maths skills for precise measurements and managing your business finances
Interpersonal skills for building both client relationships and your reputation
Attention to detail for inch-perfect installations
Building and construction knowledge for approaching different types of interiors and building entrances
Skilled tradespeople get your business started 
Join Checkatrade today  Join Now How do I start a door fitting business?
First things first you’ll have to register your business with HMRC for legal reasons. When doing so, you’ll also need to choose between a sole trader or limited company as the structure for your business. Opting to run your business as a sole trader tends to be the easier route, with less paperwork and admin involved. However, you won’t get the same financial security as you would with a limited company structure. These are just some of the pros and cons to consider when making your decision. For a helpful comparison, check out our guide  here .
Preparing for success
There’s no use in starting your door fitting business without doing your homework first. You should create a business plan that covers the ins and outs of the services you will offer and the type of clients you hope to attract. Here are some door fitting business ideas which you could use as inspiration to help you decide what you want to offer:
Specialise in fitting UPVC doors
Offer door repairs and replacements as part of your service
Provide a 24-hour express service for emergency callouts
Specialise in fire doors and safety testing
Specialising your services helps you to effectively target a specific market which will give you a competitive edge. It’s worth researching what local competitors are offering to spot any gaps your business may be able to fill.
Insurance Public liability insurance  – If your customers are mostly homeowners, you’ll need this insurance policy in place. It will cover claims made against you by members of the public and covers the cost of compensation for personal injuries, loss or damage to property etc Professional indemnity insurance  – There’s always a chance you make a mistake or complete work that a client isn’t happy with. This type of insurance will protect you from claims in these situations
Tools insurance – Covers replacement costs if your equipment is lost or stolen as a result of theft, fire or flooding
Pricing
You’ll need to assess competitors in your local area and charge similar prices to keep yourself in the competition. You should avoid the temptation to set your prices too low with the intention to undercut the market as you need to cover your day-to-day costs while you become established. However, if you decide to include services which give you a unique selling point, this should be reflected in the prices you charge. For example, you are entitled to charge premium prices if you’re working on a complex project that takes longer than normal.
How to run your door fitting business
Once you’ve set yourself up, there are a few things you’ll need to dedicate your time towards to keep your business running smoothly.
Revenue
The only way to check you’re making profit, and by how much, is to regularly check your cashflow. You need to stay on top of recording all your income and expenditure to gain a good idea of how your door fitting business is going. It is completely normal to be operating at a loss in the beginning, given all the upfront costs that come with setting up a business. This is not out of the ordinary but if you’re concerned you could consider taking out a business loan. In which case, just ensure you understand the terms and can pay the repayment schedule on time. For more information on keeping your books in order, click  here .
Taxes
Managing your taxes is another part of the territory when setting up a new business. As part of your finances, you’ll need to file your taxes but these vary according to the business structure so check which you should be filing for. If you’re struggling to dedicate the time to this task or you’re generally unsure about how to document your taxes, hiring an accountant to help could be an option. For more information on employing an accountant, read our guide  here .
Digital Marketing
If you want to grow your business, you’ll need to get into the habit of self-promotion. Creating an online presence via websites and paid advertising is especially important There are many different marketing strategies you can use to get your name out there but  signing up to Checkatrade  is best for tradespeople. Upon joining, your business will be visible to over three million monthly site users who could become your customers. Not only does membership raise your online profile, but also lets you showcase images of your finest work and display customer recommendations to enhance your reputation. If you’re aiming to offer door fitting as a subcontracted service, membership will also get you in front of other business owners and you can take the conversation from there.
Social media is another tool you should make use of. You can share images and videos of completed jobs, while building rapports with new customers and clients who may be in need of door fitting.
Print Marketing
Though traditional, print is still an effective way to promote your business in a local area. If your target customers are homeowners, you can distribute flyers or leaflets in target neighbourhoods to drum up new business and spread the word. Look out for properties that have land to build on as these will be areas most likely to build extensions.
Should you want to develop contracts with construction companies, business cards are a great promotional tool to hand out to potential clients. You also shouldn’t underestimate the power of a phone call.
Your van is also an easy way to market the business. Include your business name and contact details and watch how effective this is for getting your name out there. For more advice on buying vehicle graphics, read our guide  here .
FAQs
How much can I earn as a self-employed door fitter? 
The amount your door fitting business earns will depend on the volume of work you are able to secure, as well as how much you charge and your ability to complete work on time.
When starting out, a trained door fitter can earn around £26,500
Experienced door fitters can earn up to £45,500, or more
What is the daily rate for door fitting?
The average rate for a day of door fitting is around £120-£200. It will vary depending on the type of door fitting services you offer and what price is considered competitive in your area.
Is door fitting a profitable business?
Door fitting is a specialist craft which requires the expertise of a skilled carpenter with a high degree of skill, judgement and experience. The window, door and conservatory industry is a thriving market with a variety of products and services to offer. As such, there’s plenty of opportunity to make a tidy profit.

What to do when your boiler pilot light has gone out,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/boiler-pilot-light-gone-out/,Kitchen,"What to do when your boiler pilot light has gone out

In This Blog: What to do if the pilot light goes out What happens if the pilot light goes out Who to call when the pilot light goes out FAQs Has your boiler pilot light gone out? If so, there’s no need to panic as it’s not always a sign of bad news. Read on for what to do if your boiler pilot light has gone out, and who to call. What to do if the pilot light goes out Your boiler pilot light is a very important part of your boiler. The pilot light or flame needs to be lit all the time to make sure that your boiler can produce hot water for your taps and central heating as and when it is needed.
If your pilot light goes out, identify if your boiler has a manual or automatic pilot light. Find your instruction manual or look up your boiler model online. If you have an automatic pilot light you
 MUST NOT
 try to light it manually.
Top tip:
 It will be handy to have a torch close by for this.
Igniting an automatic pilot light
Switch off the boiler at the mains. The switch could be on the boiler itself. You can also flip the breaker switch to the off position in your fuse box.
Remove the boiler’s access panel and turn the gas control knob to the off position.
Let the gas dissipate, it’s best to wait for about 15 minutes, and it is advisable to open a window.
Turn the gas control knob to its on position and turn the boiler back on (don’t forget to also turn the breaker switch back on). You should hear a clicking sound. This is the automatic starter that ignites the pilot light.
If yours doesn’t ignite after 30 seconds, or the clicking sound doesn’t stop then it is time to  call a professional .
Igniting a manual pilot light
Turn your boiler’s gas control knob to the “off” position and wait up to 15mins for any gas to dissipate.
Turn the thermostat down to its lowest setting.
Remove the boiler cover and locate the pilot light jet.
Turn the gas control knob to the pilot setting and press the knob to release gas into the pilot light hole.
Light a match and place it into the pilot light hole. Keep pressing the gas control knob down. Keep it pressed until the flame starts to burn blue.
Remove the match and keep the knob pressed for at least another 30 seconds to keep the flow of gas coming.
Release the knob and, if successful the pilot light should stay lit.
If you cannot light the pilot light, or it keeps going out then this would indicate that the problem lies elsewhere and it’s time to  call in the help of a professional .

Find your local boiler repair engineer  What happens if the pilot light goes out As mentioned above, if your boiler pilot light goes out, you won’t be able to get any hot water from your taps and your central heating won’t function.
Your boiler’s pilot light could go out for various reasons including a loose or broken gas valve, faulty thermocouples or heat exchangers, a vent issue, low gas pressure, or even high winds.
If you have tried to relight the pilot light yourself you can also try to clean the jet, as even tiny specs of debris can cause the jet to be blocked. If your pilot light repeatedly goes out, it could mean there is an underlying issue that needs to be fixed.
Safety always comes first, so we would always advise contacting a heating engineer for them to make a professional assessment and repair if needed.
Cleaning the pilot light jet
Switch off the gas, open a window and wait 15 minutes for the gas to dissipate.
Remove the pilot light and thermocouple assembly. When you open the furnace, you should see a small bracket holding the pilot light and thermocouple. Older models require the full assembly to be pulled out, while newer furnaces can simple have them removed individually.
Use your pliers or wrench to remove the pilot light and thermocouple from the bracket.
Using the wire brush, brush away the carbon buildup and soot from both components.
For hard to reach areas and stubborn buildup, use the metal file.
Wipe away dust with a soft cloth or burst of compressed air.
Return both components to the bracket and reinstall the assembly.
Test the pilot light. Who to call when the pilot light goes out When your pilot light goes out you might be wondering whether you should call a plumber or a heating engineer.
Although plumbers deal with heating systems that include radiators and pipework, they are not legally required to be on the Gase Safe register.
As boiler repairs require working with gas, you should leave all boiler servicing jobs to a  qualified gas fitter  who is on the Gas Safe register.
For more information on costs, take a look at our  boiler repair cost guide .

Find your local boiler repair engineer  FAQs Is it dangerous if the pilot light goes out?
It depends on why the pilot light went out. If it was something simple such as a dirty pilot hole or a worn-out part then these are easier to fix. If you can smell gas then it is time to call in the  professionals .
If you have an enclosed burner then you should not attempt any DIY fixes and you should contact a professional.

Before tiling your fireplace, your tile installer will expect you to prepare the walls and surfaces. Tiling over a brick fireplace should be straightforward, but costs will vary depending on your choice of tile.
Porcelain tiles are popular choices for fireplaces but can be a pain to fit, and so expect the tiling costs per metre square to reflect this. Labour cost to tile a fireplace A tiler will charge between 
£30 – £40

£177 per metre square, 
this will include tiling over brick with tile backer board.
As a ballpark figure, we’d suggest 
£100
 but check with your local tiling expert for accurate prices – as these costs are estimates only.

In This Blog: Water pump for your house price Submersible pump price Solar water pump price FAQs about water pump prices The price of a water pump and installation depends on what you need it for and how many litres of water you need to pump. There are different models available on the market and we’ll cover domestic water pumps for low-flow rates, submersible water pumps and solar water pumps. We’ll also cover installation costs.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Water pump for your house price A domestic water pump price can vary depending on what you need it to do.
There are pumps that:
Prevent flooding in your home
 – you can find out more about  water removal services  in our dedicated guide
Help with low pressure 
– these pumps, also known as low-flow pumps, come at different costs depending on the rate of water they can pump.
In the UK, good mains water pressure is around 10 – 15 litres per minute. If yours is less than this then you may benefit from the professional installation of a booster pump. This type of pump is legally only able to take your flow rate up to 12 litres per minute. You can expect to pay on average between 
£220
 – 
£400 for a low-flow pump including installation
.
Remember that working on your home’s mains water supply yourself can be hazardous and  hiring a professional  is always recommended. Considerable damage can be done to your property if things go wrong.
To get accurate quotes for your pump project, enter your postcode in the free search tool below to find water pump installers recommended by your neighbours.

Find water pump experts your neighbours rate  Submersible pump price Whether you’re looking to create a water feature in your pond or extract standing water from a construction site, a submersible pump sits permanently under a body of water.
Prices vary greatly depending on the amount of water you need pumping away. You can expect to pay on average around 
£150 for a small pond pump including installation
, and up to 
£2,700 for a large pond including installation.
When choosing the right submersible, you’ll need to consider the flow of water you need to create, and the head height (distance from water level to the highest point of use), as that will dictate the litres per minute you need. A professional can help you work out all of these and give you an accurate quote for your specific project. Solar water pump price Providing an environmentally friendly and carbon-neutral option, solar water pumps don’t require mains electricity or diesel to power them. Instead, they have a solar panel that harvests sunlight and stores the converted energy for the pump to use.
Solar water pump prices depend on how much water you need to pump, with small pond pumps and installation costing on average between 
£20 – £300
 for domestic usage and agricultural solar pumps costing on average between
 £150 – £4,000
 for industrial-scale irrigation. FAQs about water pump prices How much is the cost of a water pump?
There is a world of water pumps for different uses; from pumps for a small pond or a rainwater butt through to high-flow-rate pumps for agricultural and farming use.
You’ll need to know what you need your pump for, then you can get an expert to advise you on the exact cost. As a guide to average costs, submersible water pump prices including installation can start at
 £150
 and run through to 
£2,700.
A low flow domestic water pump price can be between 
£220
 – 
£400
 including installation. And a solar water pump price comes in at between 
£20 – £300
 for domestic use and
 £150 – £4,000
 for commercial use.
How much is a water pump for a home?
If low mains water pressure is a problem in your house, then you have the option of hiring a professional to install a low-flow water pump to boost the pressure.
It’s advisable to get an expert’s advice on this, as you can only legally have a maximum 12 l/m water pump installed, and you can expect to pay between 
£220
 – 
£400
 including installation.
Which water pump is best for home use?
When considering your options for a domestic water pump, there are two main considerations. First, you need to know whether the pump is needed to boost low pressure or to assist with a flooding problem. And secondly, as your chosen professional will be installing your water pump in your home, you’ll want to get one that’s as quiet as possible when running.

Garden room planning permission,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/garden-room-planning-permission/,Garden,"Garden room planning permission

In This Blog: Do I need planning permission for my garden room? How to get garden room planning permission Looking to build a garden room? How much does a garden room cost to be installed by a professional? FAQs One of the most common complaints by homeowners is the lack of space in their properties. One solution for this is to  add an extension , but this can be costly and time-consuming. An alternative option is to install a garden room.
In this guide, we’ll be taking a closer look at garden room planning permission, including when you need it, permitted development and the application process. Do I need planning permission for my garden room? The benefits of garden rooms are numerous, from extra living space to having a private sanctuary in your own garden. Generally, you won’t need planning permission for a garden room, but this isn’t always the case.
Garden rooms are classed as outbuildings and are often considered permitted development. However, there are certain circumstances where you’ll need permission to build your garden room. If your garden room falls into any of the below categories, then it’s likely you will need planning permission:
Your home is a listed building
You will be living in or operating a business from your garden room
Your new structure covers above 50% of your land
The garden room is at the front of your property
The structure has a raised platform or balcony
Your new outbuilding is more than one storey or 3 metres high
It has eaves that are over 2.5 metres high
For further guidance on garden room planning permission, take a look at the  outbuildings page  on Planning Portal’s website. In addition, if you’re at all confused about whether you need planning permission to build your garden room, we’d recommend contacting your local planning department.
What are the new rules for building in a back garden?
In 2020,  new permitted development rules  came into play that affects whether or not you need to apply for planning permission. Please note, these rules don’t apply to listed buildings, flats, and homes outside Britain. Generally, these rules apply to the size, position and use of your garden room, so make sure your new structure is:
Only one storey high
Less than 10 square metres big and more than 20 metres from your property if you live in a conservation area
Either more than 2 metres from your property boundary or less than 2.5 metres high
Not built to the front or side of your home if you live in a conservation area
Not located in your front garden
Not fitted with a microwave antenna

Find a local garden room specialist  How to get garden room planning permission If your planned structure falls into any of the above categories, you’ll need to apply for planning permission. The process isn’t too complex, although it can take weeks to get approval for your garden room, so factor this into your plans. To apply, you’ll need to fill out an application that goes to your local planning authority for approval. You can do this online through the  gov.uk website .
You will also need to think about building regulations. In certain situations, you may need to apply for this in addition to planning permission. Even if your garden room falls outside the requirement for building regulations, it’s well worth following these anyway to ensure your new structure is well built and insulated.
If your new outbuilding will be over 15 square metres, will be used for sleeping or is more than one metre from your property boundary, you’ll usually need to apply for building regulations approval. You can submit your application through the  gov.uk website . Looking to build a garden room? While you may be able to do some of the work yourself, we’d strongly recommend hiring a tradesperson for high-quality, long-lasting results. This is especially important for anything that requires you to work with electricity, gas or plumbing as this can be very risky.
So, how can you find the right person for your job? Well, the most important thing when undertaking any type of project is to find a team of professionals you can trust. At Checkatrade, our members pass through 12 checks to make sure you get the best possible service.
Just type your postcode into our  free search feature  to find a range of professionals recommended by your neighbours. We’re so confident about our members that we have introduced a  guarantee , which means if in the rare case anything does go wrong, we’ll give you up to £1,000 to put things right ( T&Cs  apply).
For further support when it comes to home improvements and finding the right worker for your job, check out the  HomeOwners Alliance  website. You’ll find handy guides and advice for a range of different projects. How much does a garden room cost to be installed by a professional? Once you’ve decided to hire a qualified professional to build your garden room, you may wonder how much this will cost. While building a garden room is generally cheaper than an extension, it’ll still cost an average of 
£2,650
 for a mini garden office, plus 
£690
 for assembly.
Of course, the larger the garden room, the more it’ll cost and for a big, log cabin style garden room you may pay up to 
£30,000
. For more prices and considerations, check out our  garden room cost guide. Once your garden room is installed, it may be worth investing in some new garden landscaping to further enhance your outside space. It can cost between 
£50 – £100
 for decking. To learn more, check out our  garden landscaping cost guide. 
Find a local garden room specialist  FAQs What is backland development?
Backland development applies to any structure built in your back garden. If you’re adding a structure then you’re conducting backland development.
How do I get planning permission to build a house in my garden?
If you plan to build a house in your garden, you’ll definitely need planning permission and building regulations approval. You can apply for these through the government website pages on  planning permission  and  building regulations. Which tradespeople should I use for the job?
There are a range of companies that provide garden rooms. However, if you want a garden room that perfectly suits your outside space and your requirements, it’s well worth building from scratch. To build a custom structure, you’ll need the help of different tradespeople.

How to install a Ring Doorbell,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/install-ring-doorbell/,Tag Not Found,"How to install a Ring Doorbell

In This Blog: How to install a Ring Doorbell How to install a Ring Doorbell on brick without drilling How to attach a Ring Doorbell to a uPVC door How to install a Ring Doorbell Pro with plug-in adapter How to set up a Ring Doorbell FAQs Ring Doorbells have become commonplace in homes across the UK, with the added security benefits an attractive feature for homeowners.
Wondering how to install a Ring Doorbell? Our guide will take you through the steps, with some top tips and FAQs too. You may also be considering automating your home fully. Check out our  home automation cost guide  for more information. How to install a Ring Doorbell As you’d expect for a globally recognised brand, a Ring Doorbell is a relatively easy product to install. Simply follow these steps:
Before starting the installation, fully charge the battery in your Ring Doorbell using the cable provided in the box. Your Ring Doorbell is fully charged when the light on the top glows green.
Remember to insert the fully charged battery into the bottom of your doorbell. It’s secure when you hear and feel a click.
Use the manual to check all of the parts needed for installation are in the box before you start.
You’ll need a screwdriver, and possibly a drill (make sure it’s fully charged if cordless), pencil and hammer depending on the model you’ve bought and the mounting method you choose. Be sure to use a pencil instead of a pen, in case you need to reposition the doorbell before drilling.
Give yourself an hour for the job and ideally do it on a dry day.
Top tip: If you’re at all unsure about how and where to drill, we recommend
 hiring a handyperson
 to take the job off your hands. Find out how much  doorbell installation costs . How to install a Ring Doorbell on brick without drilling Whether you live in a rented property and are worried about potential repairs, you don’t have a drill, or you simply don’t want to drill into your brickwork, here’s how to install a Ring Doorbell without drilling:
Find the no-drill mount in the Ring Doorbell box. The no-drill mount will have double-sided adhesive on the back.
Choose your Ring Doorbell’s location, ideally around 48 inches from the ground.
Hold the no-drill mount in the location you want it, make sure it’s level and make a mark on the wall in pencil.
Remove the covering on the adhesive, line up with your pencil mark and press firmly against the brick wall.
Ensure the mount is firmly attached to the wall by holding it with pressure for two minutes.
Line up your Ring Doorbell and screw it into the no-drill mount plate.
Push on the faceplate and secure using the security screw on the underside.
Your Ring Doorbell installation is complete.

Find local Ring doorbell installers recommended by your neighbours  How to attach a Ring Doorbell to a uPVC door There are two ways to install your Ring Doorbell if you’re planning on attaching it to a uPVC door frame:
Installing your Ring Doorbell without screwing into the uPVC
Find the no-drill mount in the box, take off the strip covering the adhesive on the back and stick to your uPVC frame where you want the doorbell to be located. This should be around 48 inches up from the ground.
Hold with some pressure for two minutes to ensure the mount is firmly stuck to the uPVC frame.
Line your Ring Doorbell up and use the screws included to attach it to the mount.
Pop the faceplate on and tighten the security screw underneath the unit.
Good to know:
 If you ever need to remove the no-drill mount, find the two tapes behind the top of the mount and pull both upwards together. How to install a Ring Doorbell Pro with plug-in adapter If you’ve gone for the Ring Doorbell Pro, then your installation will require the use of a plug socket in order to run a cable to power the doorbell unit. Here’s how to hardwire a Ring Doorbell and install a Ring Doorbell Pro:
First of all, locate the nearest usable socket to where the doorbell will be located. Don’t plug the adapter in yet.
Run the cable to the Ring Doorbell unit location and attach it to your wall along the way using the clips you’ll find in the box.
Take the cable through the wall to the rear of your doorbell.
Once you’ve done this, you need to install your doorbell as with any Ring model. If you don’t have a plug socket in place, we recommend getting an  electrician  in to do this for you.
Installing a Ring Doorbell Pro using a drill:
Click the included level tool into the front, just underneath the camera.
Choose where you want your Ring Doorbell to be located. This should be around 48 inches from the ground.
Line up your doorbell on the wall or door frame and ensure it’s completely level using the level tool.
Mark the surface behind using the mounting holes and a pencil.
Drill holes and insert the plastic anchors.
Secure the cable into the back of the doorbell.
Line up the doorbell and secure with the included screws.
Place on the faceplate and secure with the included security screw.
Installing a Ring Doorbell pro without using a drill:
Stick the no-drill mount in the box to your wall surface or door frame, 48 inches up from the ground.
Hold with pressure for two minutes.
Secure the cable into the back of the doorbell.
Line your Ring Doorbell up and attach it to the mount.
Add the faceplate and security screw underneath.
Then simply plug in, turn on and start using your Ring Doorbell. How to set up a Ring Doorbell With your Ring Doorbell installed, you now need to set it up. This is fairly simple and requires you to have a smartphone and wifi. Follow these steps:
Download the Ring app from the App Store or Play Store.
You’ll need to log in or create an account.
Find the QR code or MAC ID barcode on your Ring device or on the packaging and scan it using your phone.
Enter your geographical location and name your device.
Connect your doorbell to the Ring wifi network and to your wifi network
Test your Ring Doorbell and you’re good to go!

Find local Ring doorbell installers recommended by your neighbours  FAQs Is a Ring Doorbell easy to install?
Compared to other home security and convenience installations, a Ring Doorbell is easy to install. It should take around an hour and requires basic tools. That said, if you’re at all unsure or don’t have the right tools, we recommend  hiring a professional  to do the job properly.
Does a Ring Doorbell require wiring?
The standard Ring Doorbell is completely wireless, using a rechargeable battery for power and wifi for a network. The Ring Doorbell Pro is a wired model, requiring a hardwired cable to be connected for a constant power supply. You will need to hire an  electrician  for this.
What’s needed to install a Ring Doorbell?
This depends based on the model you go for. With a standard Ring Doorbell, you’ll either need a screwdriver and a drill, or just a screwdriver if using the no-drill mount. If you’re installing a Ring Doorbell Pro, you’ll need the same again depending on your install, plus a hammer to secure the power cable to your walls.
If you’re short on time or don’t have the tools to install your Ring Doorbell, simply

How to make your garden more private,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/make-your-garden-more-private/,Garden,"How to make your garden more private

In This Blog: Top tips on how to make your garden more private Landscaping ideas to block neighbours Are there any restrictions concerning garden privacy? FAQs Expert help to make your garden more private Your garden is your personal outdoor space, a natural sanctuary to enjoy and relax in, so it’s understandable that you’d want to make it as private as possible.
There are a number of things you can do to improve the privacy of your garden and prevent neighbours from being able to see into your outdoor space. We’ll take a look at them in this guide and answer some common questions on how to make a garden more private. Top tips on how to make your garden more private If you feel your garden is overlooked by neighbours, there are a number of things you can do to make your garden more private.
You can start by erecting fences to the maximum height, which in the UK is 2m or 6’6”. There are a range of fence designs to choose from that are attractive for both you and your neighbours to look at, so don’t feel you have to go for a basic wall-like appearance.
If this isn’t enough, you can go higher than this, but you’ll need  planning permission  from your local authority.
Planting hedges or small trees along the edges of your outdoor area is a great, natural way of making an overlooked garden more private. Although these may start small, they will grow to create a complete screen, preventing neighbours from seeing into your garden. They’re also great for wildlife, such as birds and insects. Landscaping ideas to block neighbours Beyond fences and hedges, garden screening from neighbours can be achieved through landscaping. This could include stonework,  pergolas ,  water features , and permitted buildings that screen the fence lines between you and your neighbours.
We recommend contacting a professional  landscaper  to create your perfect private garden. They will know the best ways to get the most out of your space with the best privacy techniques that will complement your existing space. Are there any restrictions concerning garden privacy? When trying to make your garden more private you just need to be aware that in the UK, you can’t erect a fence higher than 2m, or 6’6”, without planning permission from your local authority.
You also need to keep any fast-growing shrubs on your garden’s borders down to 2m as well. This is because hedges comprising two or more evergreens are regulated by the Anti-Social Behaviour Act (2003) and if your neighbour feels you are in breach of this law, they can report you to the police.
Keep these regulations in mind, but also just think about keeping a good relationship with your neighbours. Tell them what you’re planning on doing and why, keep them in the loop and sell the benefits of a private garden to them, too!

Find a landscaper that your neighbours recommend  FAQs How can I stop my neighbours from overlooking my garden?
The reality is, in most cases, your neighbours won’t want to be overlooking your garden, but that doesn’t stop you from wanting to prevent it. If a neighbour is overlooking your garden from a low-level, then fences to the maximum 2m height are a great idea, as well as shrubs and trees such as beech and japonica.
If your neighbours are higher up, consider bamboo or a pergola with a rambling rose on top to screen you from above.
How can I make my garden private faster?
Fences are probably the fastest way to establish garden screening from neighbours in the UK. But there are also a range of fast-growing bushes and low-level trees you can plant, such as:
Arborvitae
Cherry Laurel
Bay Laurel
Privet
Leylandii
Bamboo
While these won’t do the job overnight, you’ll see significant screening after a year of growth.
How do I block out my neighbour’s view?
This depends on where they are viewing your garden from. If it’s from an elevated position, then consider a pergola over a patio, or fast-growing shrubs around the edge of your outdoor area.
If it’s from ground-level, go for a maximum 2m metre fence and maybe consider growing a shrub up the fence to ramble over the top and make the dividing line between your two properties look more attractive.
Do I have a right to privacy in my garden?
There aren’t any laws that entitle you to privacy in your garden in the UK. However, there are regulations around nuisance that can be enforced, including noise, smoke from a BBQ and excessive lighting.
The Noise Act 1996 makes it easier for you to stop loud, disruptive music or a dog barking, particularly between the hours of 11 pm – 7 am.
How high can you have screening in your garden?
Current laws allow for garden screening from neighbours in the UK to be 2m, or 6’6”, high, including fences, trees, shrubs and bushes along a boundary line.
You can go higher with planning permission from your local authority, but be aware that your neighbours will be asked to comment on the application. Expert help to make your garden more private When it comes to boundary lines in your garden, there are a number of risks, both legally and relationship-wise to consider. It’s always best to seek the advice of a professional on what’s possible on your property.
Getting the help of an experienced landscaper or garden privacy specialist will also enable you to achieve privacy and a beautiful garden that you’ll love being in. And that’s the whole point of privacy in the first place!

How to install a dishwasher,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/install-dishwasher/,Kitchen,"How to install a dishwasher

In This Blog: How to plumb in a dishwasher How to connect a dishwasher and washing machine to one waste pipe How to fit an integrated dishwasher How to fit an integrated dishwasher door How to install a tabletop dishwasher How to fit a dishwasher in a small kitchen Do you need a plumber to install a dishwasher? How to find a trustworthy expert How much does a dishwasher cost to be installed by a professional? Which tradespeople should you use for the job? Dishwashers are no longer just a luxury item. They have become a key component in many homes throughout the country. Not only that, they’ve single-handedly stopped the argument of who’s washing up and who’s drying!
Now that dishwashers are as much standard in a property as a washing machine, it does mean that when your dishwasher suddenly stops working, you need it to be repaired or replaced as quickly as possible. Learning how to install a new dishwasher may be essential to keep your home running efficiently.
This article is perfect whether your dishwasher has broken down, you’re buying your first dishwasher, or you just want to upgrade to a shiny new model.
Keep reading if you’re looking for steps on installing a new dishwasher. Repairing a dishwasher is another story, so we recommend that you check our  dishwasher repair costs . 
We would always recommend getting a professional to quote for the repair. It’s worth finding out first-hand if your appliance is 
worth repairing.
Before beginning, gather the following tools:
Bucket
Spanner
Screwdriver
Towels to mop up any drips

Find plumbers trusted by your neighbours  How to plumb in a dishwasher Ok, now you have everything to hand, use the below steps to install a dishwasher:
Start by turning off the water supply to your dishwasher. There may be a stopcock you can turn next to the appliance, but if not, you’ll need to switch off your mains water supply.
If you’re replacing an old machine, make sure to slowly pull it away from the wall. You can then unplug the electricity supply.
Position a bucket underneath the pipes and carefully detach the waste hose from the drainage pipe.
Detach the cold-water supply from your dishwasher hose, again using a bucket to catch the drips. You can then move the old dishwasher out of the area you are working in.
Slide your new dishwasher towards its planned location.
Next, join the cold-water supply to the dishwasher cold water hose. Make sure this is properly tightened using a spanner. At this point, you can open the cold-water valve again.
Attach the drainage pipe to your new appliance’s waste hose. You’ll need to tighten the clip using a screwdriver.
Plug the dishwasher into a power socket and switch your mains water supply back on.
Test that there are no leaks or issues by running a dishwasher cycle.
Top tip: If there is a leak that you cannot fix, now is a good time to call in a plumber.
Finally, slide the dishwasher into its new position.
Perfect, you now know how to plumb in a dishwasher.
Get help if you need it.

Find plumbers trusted by your neighbours  How to connect a dishwasher and washing machine to one waste pipe It’s very common for kitchens in the UK to have more than one appliance, making light work of dull household chores. To save time and space, it’s possible to learn how to install a dishwasher and washing machine together. If this is something you are considering, why not check out our guide on  how to connect a dishwasher and washing machine to one waste pipe ?
With advice and tips, this article covers the most important steps to plumb these machines together. Plus, you’ll find guidance on common kitchen issues like draining a washing machine and how to extend a drain hose.
On the other hand, if you want to learn to install a washing machine separately, please see our  how to plumb in a washing machine guide. How to fit an integrated dishwasher The main difference between fitting a dishwasher and an integrated dishwasher is that the latter has a few extra steps to fix it in place. To fit an integrated dishwasher, use the above step-by-step guide to plumb in your dishwasher, then use the below tips to finish the installation:
Once your dishwasher is connected, ensure it’s at the right height and level with your worktops. You can usually adjust the feet of your appliance to alter the height.
Attach the clips that came with your integrated dishwasher to the surfaces surrounding the machine. Please note, you may need to use a screwdriver.
Finally, slide your dishwasher in place and ensure the clips engage. How to fit an integrated dishwasher door One of the best ways to seamlessly blend your dishwasher into your kitchen is to add an integrated dishwasher door. These doors are fitted in front of your appliance, blocking it from view and creating the illusion that it’s just another cupboard.
If you have an integrated dishwasher and want to learn how to fit an integrated dishwasher door, use the following tips:
The first step is to buy a door that works well in your kitchen. You can either pick a door that matches the rest of your kitchen cupboards or select another finish that fits with your design scheme.
Your door will come with a fixing plate (the surface that sits between your dishwasher and the integrated door). You’ll need to use a pencil to mark where the metal connectors and door rollers need to be attached to the fixing plate.
You can then attach the door rollers and connection pieces.
Once everything is tightly screwed into place, you can slide the integrated door onto the rollers.
Finally, attach any remaining fixings to hold the door in place. How to install a tabletop dishwasher Tabletop dishwashers work in a similar way to standard dishwashers. They’re just smaller and designed to sit on your worktop instead of underneath. You need to connect a tabletop dishwasher using the method outlined earlier in this guide.

How to lay vinyl flooring in 5 steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/lay-vinyl-flooring/,Bathroom,"How to lay vinyl flooring in 5 steps

In This Blog: Top tips on how to lay your vinyl flooring How to lay vinyl flooring in a bathroom in 5 steps How to lay vinyl flooring in the kitchen FAQs about laying vinyl flooring answered Ensure a professional finish for your vinyl floor If you’re here then you’re thinking about how to lay vinyl flooring yourself. It’s possible, but it requires the right tools, plenty of time and attention to detail.
In this guide, we’ll cover top tips on how to lay vinyl flooring and look specifically at laying vinyl flooring in a bathroom and a kitchen. We’ll also answer your vinyl flooring questions! Top tips on how to lay your vinyl flooring If you’re considering laying a vinyl floor yourself then we’ve got a number of top tips to help you get it right the first time. You only have one shot at cutting and laying!
Measure twice, cut once
This has never been truer than when laying a vinyl floor. Make sure you double or even triple-check the m2 of your room.
To do this measure the length and width and multiply them, ensuring you measure the longest sections (in non-square spaces).
Add 10% of vinyl when ordering – for cuts and wastage
Whether you’re ordering your vinyl flooring online or in-person, you’ll be asked for your area in m2. Ensure you add 10% to the total area to allow for wastage and mistakes.
This is crucial as planks and pieces will need to be cut, which can result in unusable pieces.
Get the right vinyl-cutting tools
Whether you hire them or buy them, you’ll need the right tools in order to cut your vinyl flooring efficiently and accurately without rough edges or mistakes.
For vinyl rolls of flooring, you’ll want a very sharp stanley knife and a long metal ruler or piece of timber to give you a straight line. For tougher vinyl planks, you’ll need a saw, either a fine-blade handheld one, or an electric circular model. You’ll also need a bolster chisel to get vinyl sheeting firmly into your room’s corners.
Always lay vinyl flooring on a flat surface
The last thing you want when you’ve spent all of your time, effort and money measuring, cutting and buying your dream vinyl floor is for it to be bumpy, uneven and even creaky underfoot.
How to lay vinyl flooring on plywood – step by step
It’s always advisable to lay plywood over floorboards first and screed an uneven concrete floor in order to achieve a perfectly level surface for your vinyl flooring.
Simply cut your plywood sheets to fit the size and shape of your room and lay them in place, secured with small tack nails.
Then take your roll of vinyl or vinyl planks and begin laying from one corner, allowing for enough to go under skirting boards if necessary.
With almost all vinyl flooring you don’t need a layer of underlay between the plywood and the vinyl.
Factor in the pattern when laying vinyl planks
It’s not a consideration if you’re laying a roll of vinyl flooring, but if you’re putting down vinyl planks that resemble timber flooring, then you need to ensure the joints are staggered.
This ensures rigidity and strength in the flooring, just like in a brick wall, minimising the chance of uplift. It also looks more attractive and realistic.
Laying vinyl sheeting in corners
When it comes to laying in corners, you’ll need to get the vinyl to be as flat on the floor as possible in order to cut accurately.
For an internal corner, cut a triangular notch starting 3-4 inches along each side and meeting in the middle. For external corners, go from the edge of the vinyl down to the sub-base or floor with a straight cut. Then trim, but leave 10cm turned up if going under skirting.
There’s a lot to learn and get right if you’re considering laying a vinyl floor for the first time. And mistakes can be costly, not always showing themselves straight away.

How to lay vinyl flooring on floorboards
Whether you’re wondering how to lay vinyl flooring on wood or floorboards, the same considerations apply.
No matter if they’re brand new or hundreds of years old, floorboards are not perfectly level. The gaps between the boards will show through vinyl flooring and potentially create weak points where damage can occur. This can result in the need for  vinyl flooring repair , which can be expensive.
The solution is to place a thin layer of plywood down first on top of the floorboards, secured with some short, flat head nails. This creates a perfectly level surface across your entire room, which you can then lay your vinyl flooring on top of as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
For an extra layer of springiness in your vinyl flooring, you can place a thin foam layer between the plywood and the flooring. This can also help to keep your vinyl flooring in place, although in most cases this is not needed.
How to cut your vinyl roll or sheeting
Using the right tools, as mentioned earlier, press your vinyl as far into the angle where your wall or skirting meets your floor or sub base. Use the bolster chisel to do this effectively and create a crease.
Then using your metal ruler or timber, push it up against the crease and cut carefully to achieve the perfect finish to your room edge. How to lay vinyl flooring in a bathroom in 5 steps First, you’ll need to remove as many items as you can from the room, and while it may not be possible to move the bath, sink or toilet, it’s advisable to clear all moveable furniture.
You might also want to remove the skirting boards to enable you to lay your flooring all the way to the walls for a professional-looking finish.
As your bathroom is potentially the wettest room in your house, the first thing to do when you get access to the floorboards is to seal any large holes or gaps.
After sealing gaps, you can lay down plywood and a layer of screed to really create a water-tight base right up to the walls. Just be aware that, while this is ideal for a vinyl underbase, it does mean that your underfloor pipework will be less accessible if you have a leak. If you’re concerned about this, just go with the plywood.
Then lay your vinyl flooring on top, fitting it around each element of your suite using accurate measurements and the right cutting tools. With vinyl sheeting, use spray adhesive or double-sided sticky tape around the edges to secure in place.
How to lay vinyl flooring around a toilet
Lay your vinyl flooring as close as you can to where the toilet pan meets the floor. As you get to the pan, if you have a roll of vinyl flooring lay it right up and around as much as you can and, giving yourself a couple of inches of excess, mark with a pen the shape of the pan on the flooring ensuring you leave enough vinyl around to reach the nearby walls.
You can then cut knowing that it will overlap the pan. This is fine, as you can then trim more easily back down to the actual shape around the pan to get a great finish.
If you’re laying vinyl planks, lay as close as you can, then offer them up to the pan and mark the cutting shape on them, leaving an inch or more too much on the plank. You can then trim back more easily for an accurate fit around the pan. How to lay vinyl flooring in the kitchen To lay vinyl flooring in a kitchen you first need to measure the total area you want to floor. In a kitchen this is particularly important, as you’ll need to decide whether you’re just going up to the kitchen units, or will floor under them as well. This will impact your total  kitchen vinyl flooring cost  as more flooring will be needed. 
Remember to measure right up to the walls, if you’ll be removing skirting boards.
With your total m2 (+10% for wastage/mistakes), you can buy your vinyl flooring. Remember to buy the same m2 of thin plywood sheets too, and small tack nails, in order to create a level surface over your floorboards.
With everything on-site, get back to the floorboards, seal any gaps in the floor, and lay your plywood without any space between, going right into every corner. Then bring in your vinyl flooring, whether plank or roll.
Begin laying from one corner, remembering that although your walls may look perfectly straight, they might not be. So offer up the vinyl to the corner and see if the wall is flush or heads away or into it. Cut appropriately. 
With vinyl planks, remember to stagger to create a strong and natural look, like with a brick wall. This may mean cutting some.
Continue laying the vinyl until the floor is covered. With planks, there’s usually no need to glue them to your sub-base. With vinyl sheeting, simply lift the edge and use spray adhesive or double-sided sticky tape to secure.
How to lay vinyl flooring over tiles
If your kitchen has floor tiles then you can still lay vinyl flooring, you just need to ensure that the surface is level. Take a look for any deep grout lines, cracks or broken tiles, and fill in, as you’ll feel all of these through your new vinyl floor covering. FAQs about laying vinyl flooring answered Do you need underlay for vinyl flooring?
In almost all cases, no. Vinyl flooring is designed to go straight onto plywood or a similar sub base. When it comes to establishing how to lay vinyl flooring on concrete, this is where the exception exists.
When you’re laying vinyl click flooring on a concrete floor you may need a layer in between, as movement can occur. In this situation, you can lay a thin foam underlay for grip.
Should vinyl flooring be glued down?
Vinyl sheeting or roll should be glued using adhesive.
Slightly different, vinyl planks gain their strength and steadfastness from the clicking connections. They do not need glueing down.
What do you put down before vinyl flooring?
As discussed in this guide, it’s important to create a completely flat and level surface before laying vinyl flooring. In most cases, this means adding a layer of thin plywood on top of your floorboards, secured with small tack nails.
Beyond this, you can place a thin layer of foam underlay down if you want a springier feel underfoot, but this generally isn’t needed.
How do you start laying vinyl flooring?
Laying a vinyl floor that will be pleasant to look at and last a long time begins with preparation of the room and purchase or hire of the right tools. All listed above.
First, you need to level the floor using plywood sheets. Then offer up your flooring to the room, starting in one corner. When cutting, remember to allow extra to go under skirting boards if they are still in place.
Make cuts that track the wall using the advice in our top tips section above and then lay your vinyl flooring across the room. This is the best way to start laying vinyl flooring yourself. Ensure a professional finish for your vinyl floor You’ll be looking at and walking on your vinyl floor for years to come, so you’ll want it to be right first time. Particularly as an inferior job will show quickly and cost significant time and money to put right.

Finding the best furniture for your rental property,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/best-furniture-for-rental-property/,"Kitchen, Living Room","Finding the best furniture for your rental property

In This Blog: The do’s and don’ts for picking the best furniture for your rental property Most durable flooring for a rental property How to keep rental property maintenance manageable FAQs for choosing the best furniture for a rental property As a landlord choosing the best furniture for your rental property is one of the key factors to making your rental a success. In this blog, we look at the main ways you can make your rental property attractive, durable and easy to maintain. The do’s and don’ts for picking the best furniture for your rental property Do
Install a good quality kitchen and bathroom that’s easy to clean
Provide enough lighting
Choose furniture and flooring that will stand up to wear and tear.
The kitchen and bathroom are the two spaces that will get the most use, so it is important to focus on these when choosing the best furniture for your rental property.
Whether you’re installing new fixtures and fittings or renovating an existing property for rental, investing in quality will serve you and your tenants best in the long run. 
For more in-depth information and costings check out our 
kitchen renovation 
and 
bathroom remodel 
cost guides
.
No one wants to live in a house that’s gloomy. To keep your rental property looking bright and inviting, make sure you have enough socket-outlets for lamps, or consider  investing in downlights .
If you need to add additional sockets then this is a simple job for a local  electrician .
Don’t
Include family heirlooms, antiques or sentimental items
Struggle on with old doors and windows
Dismiss including second-hand furniture
To avoid complaints from tenants, make sure that doors and windows are in good working order. An  internal door  could cost you as little as £60 to replace. By ensuring your  window seals , lock and glazing are in the best condition you not only provide peace of mind but can also keep your energy bills lower.
When it comes to providing the best furniture for your rental property, you can’t overlook soft furnishings and staple pieces such as tables and chairs. Most tenants will expect these items to be in situ for the start of their tenancy agreement but some may choose to bring their own.
If you are providing these pieces of furniture, it can be tempting to choose inexpensive pieces but as the old saying goes, “if you buy cheap, you buy twice”. If your budget is really tight then it can be worth hunting for decent second-hand pieces and getting this  furniture refurbished .
Alternatively, if your rental property is a longer-term investment that you plan to keep in your family, you could also consider  bespoke carpentry  for furniture that is unique to your rental.
Ultimately the best furniture for your rental property is the kind that you can afford to maintain. Most durable flooring for a rental property Carpet is definitely the most common flooring found in rental property’s but it is not the most hardwearing. With this in mind, if you’re looking for the most durable home flooring then it is wise to avoid carpet in high traffic areas such as hallways and the living and dining room.
As alternatives you could consider: Laminate flooring Vinyl flooring Engineered hardwood Laminate flooring is cost-effective and incredibly versatile, as well as being easy to clean, which makes it a great option for durable flooring for a rental property. Take a look at our  laminate flooring cost guide  for more information.
Similarly, vinyl flooring is also very affordable, as well as being water-resistant. This makes vinyl flooring a great option for kitchens and bathrooms where laminate flooring is not recommended. Vinyl comes in a huge range of designs and it is easy to maintain and clean, making it one of the most durable home flooring options. Get an idea of costs with our  vinyl floor cost guide  – if you like vinyl but you would quite like an even stronger option,  luxury vinyl  is another great option!
Engineered hardwood is the most durable flooring for a rental property but it does come at a cost. Unlike a traditional hardwood floor, engineered hardwood consists of several layers of plywood or fibreboard with a very thin layer of hardwood veneer on the top.
These layers make engineered hardwood a lot more stable than full hardwood floors as it reduces problems associated with moisture, warping and swelling that come with a traditional hardwood floor.
For the best advice and guidance for the most durable home flooring for your rental property, consult with a flooring expert who can provide you with quotes for all the suitable options.

Find flooring specialists your neighbours recommend  How to keep rental property maintenance manageable Whichever fixtures and fittings you choose, there is no getting away from the fact that as a landlord there will always be things to maintain. To keep rental property maintenance manageable we recommend:
Keep up with routine checks
 – Ask your tenants how things are, don’t wait for them to complain or raise issues. Book in regular visits with your tenants to check that everything is in order.
Choose quality fittings
 – Keeping costs down is important but consider the lifespan of your furniture and fittings and invest in longevity.
Budget for repairs
 – Set aside a portion of the rental income for repairs and upgrades, or cleaning between tenants.
Garden maintenance
 – If you have a garden space, set out in your rental agreement who will maintain the area.Usually tenants maintain a garden, but as the landlord you need to provide the tools for them to do so, e.g. a lawnmower. If you are very particular about your garden then you might want to opt for  hiring a gardener . FAQs for choosing the best furniture for a rental property What does a landlord have to provide in a furnished flat?
As a bare minimum, a landlord needs to provide a place to do laundry, food preparation, and food storage. Typically in a furnished rental property you would expect to find:
4-ring hob with oven and grill.
Cooker hood or extractor fan.
Fridge and freezer, or a fridge-freezer.
Microwave oven.
Suitable and adequate kitchen cupboards for storing food.
Sink with mains water supply of cold potable water, piped supply of hot water and draining area.
Most furnished apartments include a couch, coffee and end tables, a dining room table and chairs, beds, and basic kitchen appliances. Some (but not all) may include some extras like floor or table lamps, a toaster, a microwave, and basic cookware.
Who is responsible for the maintenance of a rental property?
A landlord has to do anything that is set out in the tenancy agreement. Landlords are also generally responsible for keeping in repair:
The structure and exterior of the property including the walls, roof, foundations, drains, guttering, external pipes, windows and external doors.
Basins, sinks, baths, toilets and their pipework.
Water and gas pipes, electrical wiring, water tanks, boilers, radiators, gas fires, fitted electric fires or fitted heaters.
These repair responsibilities can’t be removed or overwritten by clauses in a tenancy agreement. Landlord’s are also not permitted to pass on the cost of any repair work to tenants

How easy is it to rip out a kitchen for a kitchen refit?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/kitchen-refit/,Kitchen,"How easy is it to rip out a kitchen for a kitchen refit?

In This Blog: Planning a kitchen refit Step-by-step: how to rip out a kitchen How to remove a kitchen worktop Kitchen drawer removal  How to remove kitchen cabinets How to dispose of your old kitchen How much does a kitchen refit cost?  FAQs A kitchen renovation is not the cheapest job, but there are ways to save time and money when refitting your kitchen.
The best way to do this is by removing your kitchen carefully so that you can reuse and recycle parts of it. Read on for our tips on how to remove a kitchen for a refit. Planning a kitchen refit Before your new kitchen can be installed, you will first need to remove your existing one. Granted, this is not the most exciting part of the project, but there are ways to use this opportunity to save money 
and
 materials.
In this post, we’ll guide you through how to rip out a kitchen, including:
Removing kitchen cabinets
Removing a kitchen worktop
Removing kitchen drawers Step-by-step: how to rip out a kitchen First things first, gas, water, and electrical fixtures need to be shut off before you begin to rip out your kitchen. It’s helpful to clearly mark these fixtures too. You should contact a professional tradesperson to disconnect any gas appliances.
With these utility supplies safely shut off, you can remove kitchen appliances such as the washing machine, oven, and fridge, and begin to rip out the kitchen units. How to remove a kitchen worktop A kitchen worktop is normally fixed to the top of the cabinets with screws.
Remove any drawers or items within the cabinets to provide easy access.
You will then be able to identify and unscrew the fixings along the underside of the worktop.
Next, carefully cut the sealant between the worktop and the wall or tiles.
It should now be possible to lift the worktop away. You may need an extra pair of hands at this point depending on the size of the worktop and what it’s made from!
If you have tiles on the wall above your worktop it may be necessary to remove the bottom row before the worktop can be taken off. Use a hammer and bolster to do this. 
Remember to wear safety goggles and thick gloves.
If your worktop has been glued to the cabinets, gently use a chisel or utility knife to cut any adhesive or caulking. Next, use a small pry bar to carefully pry the worktop away from the cabinets.
Kitchen drawer removal 
With your worktop removed, you can now remove the kitchen drawers.
Make sure your kitchen drawers are empty.
Open the drawer so it’s fully extended on its runners.
Feel for the drawer adjustments. These can be found on either side of the drawer, either under a cover on each side of the drawer or underneath the drawer (on the outer edge).
Once you’ve located the drawer adjustments, lift the levers on either side (or push the lever up if it’s underneath the drawer), and pull the drawer out, off its runners. How to remove kitchen cabinets After you’ve removed the kitchen drawers, begin removing the cabinets.
Cabinet doors
First, remove the doors from the cabinets.
The easiest way to do this is to check for a release clip. This is a tab on the back of the hinge. Press the tab in and the hinge will release from the cabinet.
If there’s no release clip, simply unscrew the hinges from the cabinet.
Remember to support the weight of the door as it comes away.
Cabinets: base units and wall units
Before removing the kitchen cabinets, make sure they’re empty and take out any internal shelves.
Base units will be fitted to the wall and adjoining cabinets using fixings and screws. Therefore it’s just a case of unscrewing the cabinets from each other, and then from the wall itself. Then simply lift the cabinet out.
When removing wall cabinets, first unscrew the cabinets from each other.
Next, look for the wall fixings. These will be located at the top and bottom, either inside or outside of the cabinet.
Unscrew the wall fixings while someone supports the weight of the cabinet as it releases from the wall.
Top tip: Hire a professional to remove your kitchen so that you can be sure it’s being removed properly. This way, you have a better chance of reusing and reselling it. How to dispose of your old kitchen An important part of planning a kitchen refit is what you’ll do with the old units and appliances.
Reuse
Your existing appliances such as your fridge, oven and washing machine could be given a new lease of life with a professional clean and service. Not only will this be cheaper than buying new ones, but it will also help reduce the waste from your refit too.
Find an  appliance repair specialist  near you and click to find an  oven cleaner  near you.
Recycle
Provided you have removed your kitchen carefully (if you don’t know where to start, we recommend getting a helping hand in) then you can recycle different parts of your kitchen such as your worktops, cabinets and sink.
You can list the items on a website such as Freecycle, eBay or even Facebook Marketplace. You’ll be surprised at what can be reused by someone else, preventing your old kitchen from going into landfill.
Skip
If your kitchen is beyond saving and disposal is your only option, then you may need to hire a skip. Here’s our guide to  skip hire prices .
How much does a kitchen refit cost? 
The average cost to fit a new kitchen is 
£1,500
. This cost is for labour only and is based on an average-sized family kitchen.
When planning your kitchen renovation, bear in mind the following factors will impact the overall cost:
The size of the kitchen being fitted
The area to be tiled (walls and floor)
The cost of the new units and appliances
Where you live
Plastering, plasterboarding, or refinishing before the new kitchen is fitted
Other costs to plan for:
Removal and disposal of existing units and appliances
Individual trades required for removing gas appliances, fitting electrics, or making alterations to mains services (water, gas, and waste)
Structural work, if needed
Finishing and decoration
Take a look at our guide on the  cost of a kitchen refit , or take a look at  how much a new kitchen costs . If you’re looking for inspiration, check out our  kitchen ideas . FAQs How long does it take to rip out a kitchen?
Expect this part of your project to take a day or two.
How long does it take to fit a kitchen?
Fitting a kitchen can take around 10 working days, depending on the size of the kitchen to be fitted and any other work involved, as outlined above.
How do I dispose of old kitchen units?
The best way to dispose of old kitchen units is to recycle them. What you may no longer need could be just the ticket for someone else’s home renovation project. Therefore consider putting your old kitchen units and appliances on free selling or recycling sites such as Freecycle or Facebook Marketplace.

The benefits of changing the direction of a staircase,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/changing-staircase-direction/,Tag Not Found,"The benefits of changing the direction of a staircase

In This Blog: The benefits of changing the direction of a staircase Materials and type of staircase Repositioning a staircase Reversing the staircase direction Is changing a staircase expensive? FAQs Changing the direction of a staircase might not be as tricky, or expensive, as you might think.
Read on to find out how repositioning a staircase can make a big difference to the look and feel of your home. The benefits of changing the direction of a staircase When planning the interior layout of our homes, we often think about knocking down walls or extending the footprint, but have you considered moving the stairs?
Reversing the staircase direction could really open up the downstairs of your home. While repositioning the staircase could create more floor space and allow more light in.
Changing your staircase direction offers many benefits. It can: 
Open up the downstairs of your home
Allow more daylight in
Improve the layout of an awkward-shaped room
Make better use of the space available
Make a design statement
Make the stairs less steep Increase the value of your home Materials and type of staircase When considering changing the staircase direction, it’s well worth speaking with an architect to understand the best options for your interior space.
There are more configurations than you might think, such as:
Straight 
Quarter-turn (L-shaped)
Half-turn (U-shaped)
Winding
Curved
Spiral
Your staircase could also become a design feature in your home. It’s not uncommon to combine these materials for striking effect:
Metal
Hardwood
Softwood
Glass

Find a carpenter your neighbours recommend  Repositioning a staircase Many homes have a staircase that runs from front to back. This can mean that the rooms at the front of the property can be narrower than you’d like, or that they take on an awkward layout. Repositioning the staircase can help to increase the size of the front rooms and create a more spacious feel.
In a narrower property, repositioning a staircase can make a big difference. It can often impact the layout of the upstairs rooms and the positioning of corridor access. This, in turn, will add value to your home.
 When planning to reposition the stairs, it may provide the opportunity to add winders or quarter-turns, depending on the space available. This creates an attractive feature within your home. Reversing the staircase direction Narrower homes can sometimes have an undesirably steep staircase. By reversing the staircase direction, you’ll not only open up a new floor plan downstairs, but you can also reduce how steep your stairs are.
Tip: Add a plinth that’s already a few steps up to make your new stairs less steep. Is changing a staircase expensive? Changing the direction of the staircase undoubtedly involves making alterations to the floor the staircase leads to. Therefore, you’ll need the skills of a professional carpenter and builder to change the arrangement of the floor.
A  carpenter  (or joiner) will cost around 
£25 per hour
. A  builder  will charge somewhere in the region of 
£25 – £35 per hour
.
Changing the staircase direction involves working at height, so budget for the cost of a safety platform too. A 1.8m folding working platform costs around 
£39 per week
 to hire.
The cost to move stairs comes in at around 
£3,100
. Typically, this includes removing the old stairs, buying the new stairs (softwood), plus labour. Read our guide on the  cost of moving your stairs  for an outline of the costs involved.
Other costs that will affect the budget for this project:
Materials – softwood is cheaper than hardwood. Glass looks great, but is expensive. Our  new staircase cost guide  includes pricing on each type
Structural works and alterations
Skimming, decorating, skirting, or making good

Find a carpenter your neighbours recommend  FAQs Are there any regulations for moving a staircase?
There are strict building regulations for staircases, and you should speak to a professional to ensure these are adhered to. In general, they cover areas such as dimensions, headroom, number of stairs before a landing is required, and the angle of the stairs.
In the vast majority of cases, you do not need planning permission to move a staircase if your design does not impact the external appearance of your property.
How much does it cost to change the staircase direction?
Changing the direction of a staircase costs on average 
£3,100
. This includes removing the old staircase and installing a new (softwood) staircase. You may also need to factor in the cost of flooring, plastering, and decorating, depending on the scope of your particular project.

In This Blog: Types of green power solutions Tips for building a green home Green home ideas Ready to make positive changes? Which tradespeople should I use for the job? With climate change becoming more urgent than ever, it’s important for homeowners to do their part with green home energy solutions.
Green home energy solutions are any changes you make to your property that help to reduce its carbon emissions and make it more sustainable. This includes small changes such as switching to LED lighting, installing new insulation or even installing solar panels, all of which are great ways to help protect the environment and reduce your energy bills. Types of green power solutions The energy efficiency of your home can be greatly improved by introducing a range of green power solutions. Whether you make small or large alterations, they all make a difference to the environment.
Some changes to consider include: Installing solar panels  to power your home (you can even sell excess energy back to the grid in warmer months)
Changing your lightbulbs to efficient CFL or LED options
Replacing your current taps and showerheads with low flow models
Choosing energy-efficient appliances when replacing older machines

Find a trusted solar panel installer  Tips for building a green home One of the best ways of making sure your property is as green as possible is to  build it from scratch . Whilst this is not something many people have the means to do, if you’re in a position to do so, you can massively reduce your carbon emissions. Plus, you can design the layout and interior of your home to fit your exact specifications.
Below are some tips for building a green home:
Install  insulation  to reduce energy loss through the walls and roof of your home
Either install solar panels or look into installing a renewable heating system, such as a biomass boiler or a  heat pump Use energy-efficient lighting
Work with an architect or designer who is familiar with building green homes
Consider a  rainwater harvesting system  to recycle water for use in your home
Use recycled or reclaimed materials to build your home
Build using natural, sustainable materials
Install double or  triple glazed windows  to help prevent energy from being wasted
Choose  underfloor heating  to more efficiently warm your home
Install  smart, efficient thermostats  to reduce wasted energy Green home ideas  You don’t need to rush out and completely transform your home overnight to make an impact, you can try some of the below ideas to make a difference:
Look for old pieces of furniture to upcycle rather than buying brand new items
Plant flowers to attract more bees Install larger windows  or add new ones in darker parts of your home to reduce your use of lighting during the day
Add air purifying plants to your home to improve air quality

Landlord responsibilities: boiler and gas safety,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/landlord-responsibilities-boiler-gas-safety/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Landlord responsibilities: boiler and gas safety

In This Blog: What are landlord responsibilities for boilers? What are landlord gas responsibilities? Book your landlord boiler service and gas safety check FAQs A landlord’s responsibility for boiler and gas safety should be one of the top priorities.
It’s a legal requirement that a qualified Gas Safe registered engineer should inspect the gas supply and appliances at a rented property at least every 12 months.
By law, a landlord must:
Repair and maintain gas pipework, flues, and appliances in a safe condition
Make an annual gas safety check on each appliance and flue
Keep a record of each safety check What are landlord responsibilities for boilers? The Landlord and Tenant Act (1985) states that landlords must keep in good repair and working order installations that supply water, gas and electricity, as well as sanitation systems. Landlords are also responsible for space heating and water heating systems.
Therefore, 
landlords are legally responsible for making sure the boiler is serviced and safe for continued use.
Why get your boiler serviced 
An annual boiler service will:
Help to protect tenants from potentially lethal gases, such as carbon monoxide
Help to ensure the efficiency of the boiler. This will save tenants money on heating bills and is better for the environment
Reduce the likelihood of emergency call outs. This means there won’t be a hit with large, unexpected bills, and tenants won’t be without heating or hot water
Tip: Make sure items are not stored around the boiler as many boilers need ventilation to run safely.
Who can carry out a boiler service?
A gas boiler service must be done every 12 months and be carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer. A Gas Safe engineer will check the boiler and its controls. They will also check for leaks to make sure the pressure is correct, and test the flue for any toxic fumes.
How much does a gas boiler service cost?
When it comes to the  cost of servicing a boiler , there are two options:
Book a boiler service as a one-off fee. This will cost around 
£80
 for a gas boiler*
Take out boiler and central heating cover. Typically, this sits in the region of 
£180 – £300 per year
, and includes any boiler breakdowns, offering you additional peace of mind
*If you have an oil, electric combi boiler, or commercial boiler, please read our post on  boiler service cost  for more information.

Find a Gas Safe engineer your neighbours recommend  What are landlord gas responsibilities? Landlord responsibilities for gas safety checks are covered under the  Gas Safety (Installation & Use) Regulations 1998 . This piece of legislation states that it’s a mandatory requirement for landlords to ensure the safety of their tenants. Landlords are legally obliged to have any gas appliances serviced with the frequency required by the manufacturer.
Any gas appliance owned by the landlord and provided for the tenant’s use is included with the landlord’s legal duties
If a tenant has their own gas appliances, not provided by the landlord, the landlord is only responsible for parts of the associated installation and pipework, but not for the appliance itself
Who can carry out a gas safety check? 
A gas safety check must be carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer. A landlord is legally required to make sure this is the case.
Tip: Make sure tenants know where and how to turn the gas supply off in the event of an emergency.
What is covered by a gas safety check?
A Gas Safe engineer will check all gas appliances within the property. This includes the boiler, cooker, and fire. All fittings, chimneys and flues will also be checked as part of this inspection.
While it’s not included within the gas safety check, it’s recommended you ask your Gas Safe engineer to also test and examine the pipework by asking for a visual examination of the pipework and for the engineer to test the tightness of the gas system, including installation pipework.
Upon completion of a gas safety check, providing all appliances are safe, you’ll be issued with a CP12 Certificate. You must give a copy of this certificate to your tenant within 28 days of issue. You must also keep copies of the gas safety checks for at least two years.
How much does a gas safety check cost?
The  cost of a gas safety certificate  is around 
£80
 and should be carried out every 10 – 12 months. Book your landlord boiler service and gas safety check To ensure compliance with the law, and to help identify any minor issues before they become major, more costly problems, book a Gas Safe engineer to visit your tenanted property.
A Gas Safe engineer is the only person legally allowed to complete this job, so use our  request a quote  feature to get multiple quotes from Checkatrade members in your area now.
What’s more, when you book a  guaranteed  tradesperson with Checkatrade, you’ll not only have peace of mind that your Gas Safe engineer comes highly recommended but also that their work is covered for 12 months.

Find a Gas Safe engineer your neighbours recommend  FAQs How long does a landlord have to fix a broken boiler?
Section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act (1985) outlines that repairs should be carried out in a ‘reasonable time’. Having no heating or hot water constitutes a hazard under the law, therefore emergency repairs should be fixed within 24-hours.
Does my landlord have to service my old boiler?
Yes. By law, a landlord is legally required to have the boiler in their tenanted property serviced every year by a Gas Safe engineer.
When should a landlord replace a boiler?
As a general rule of thumb, if the boiler is more than 15 years old, it’s often worth considering replacing it, before it starts costing you in repairs.
Some warning signs that the boiler might need replacing include: banging, whistling or gurgling noises, leaking, increased frequency of repairs, taking longer to heat up, and rooms not heating evenly throughout the property.

How to fit a tap in 6 steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/fit-tap/,"Bathroom, Garden, Kitchen","How to fit a tap in 6 steps

In This Blog: How to fit an outside tap How to fit a kitchen tap How to fit a kitchen tap with flexible hoses How to fit a mixer tap in 6 quick steps How to fit bath taps Fitting a monobloc tap Fitting a kitchen tap with a pull-out hose FAQs So, you want to know how to change a tap? Whether you’re looking to refresh your kitchen with a new style of tap or if your bathroom tap’s on the brink, then you may want to get it changed sooner rather than later.
For an experienced DIYer, replacing a tap is a relatively straightforward job. All it takes is a little planning and the correct tools. But for someone who doesn’t have hands-on experience, it can be quite an intimidating job to complete.
We’ve put together this guide with step-by-step instructions to show you how to fit a tap. We’ll also be covering tips on fitting mixer taps, monobloc taps, and answering your frequently asked questions. This guide will either guide you in changing your taps or encourage you to reach out to a professional plumber to do the job for you.
If you’re ever in doubt about your DIY abilities, then always play it safe by  hiring a professional plumber  to do the job for you. How to fit an outside tap Tools you’ll need:
A screwdriver
An adjustable spanner
An SDS drill
An 18mm SDS drill bit
A 7mm SDS drill bit
A 15mm pipe cutter
Water pump pliers
15mm pipe collar – (optional)
Step 1: Drill an 18mm hole directly through the wall
Consider where your outdoor tap will be installed, then figure out where your mains water supply is located so you can connect your tap pipework to it. We recommend having them nearby one another.
Measure the area in which your drill bit will enter the wall from the outside. When you’re drilling through the wall from the outside, make sure there’s no chance you’ll come into contact with anything on the wall’s interior.
Finally, mark where you want the outside tap to go, then start drilling.
Top tip: 
It’s important to drill the wall from the outside to prevent blowing the brick out on the outside.
When you have around an inch or so to go, switch off the hammer mode on your SDS drill and use the drill function instead.
Step 2: Affix the backplate and outdoor tap
Ensure the copper pipe inside the property is placed correctly, then drive the backplate through the wall.
If needed, cut back the copper pipework.
Once the brass backplate is flush with the wall, use a pencil and mark the three holes on the surface of the wall.
Take away the backplate and carefully use your drill to make 7mm screw holes.
Step 3: 
Attach the water supply to the copper pipe
The best way to connect this to the water supply is by adding an elbow to the copper.
Next, insert a length of pipe to the elbow you’re using (place it inside the 15mm tee fitting). This should be attached to your property’s cold water mains supply.

Find plumbers your neighbours recommend  How to fit a kitchen tap Tools you’ll need to fit a tap:
Screwdriver
Sink spanner
An adjustable wrench
Your new taps
Tap connector pipe(s)
Junior hacksaw
Pipe cutting tool
Step 1: Remove your old taps
As obvious as it sounds, before you embark on  fitting a kitchen tap , you’ll need to switch off your water supply. If you fail to do this, there’ll no doubt be a lot of water carnage in your house!
Next, turn on the taps so that they run the system dry.
Use a wrench to unfasten the nut that affixes the supply pipes to the tap. This bit can be tricky, but all you need is a little patience.
Lastly, unfasten the nut that connects your basin or bath to your taps.
Top tip:
 It’s a good idea to get someone else to hold onto the tap to stop it from turning while you unfasten the nut.
Step 2: Clean the area
Once you’ve removed your old taps, be sure to clean the area and get rid of any remaining dirt and adhesive.
Inspect the condition of your joins, pipes, and fixings. If anything needs repairing, now’s the time to do so.
Make sure that your new taps’ fittings work correctly with your old pipes. If not, then you may need an adaptor. If you’re using plastic fittings, then you may need a plumber for the pipework. And you’ll need a reducing coupler for taps with one spout (monobloc taps).
Typically, your new tap will include a 10mm pipe, which will need to increase to the 15mm supply pipe.
Your plumbing will probably already be in place if you’re carrying out this job from scratch. Be sure the tap is placed correctly so that it extends to the sink or bath.
Step 3: Positioning your new taps
Position your taps inside the sink or bath’s holes. The washers should sit in between the sink or bath’s surface and the tap. Then, affix the tap using a back nut.
Step 4: Connect the supply pipes
After you’ve attached the taps, you can then connect the supply pipes. You can either use plush-fit plastic fittings or copper piping for this.
If your taps are in an awkward position, copper piping is more suitable, although you’ll probably need a solder and blowtorch to fix the lengths together.
Step 5: Connect the water supply
Hand tighten each end until you achieve the best position so that the water runs easily. Be sure to keep your plumbing tidy so that there aren’t any turns or twists.
Finally, tighten each end.
Step 6: Detecting leaks
Turn on the water gently, so the taps run. Even the tiniest drop of water can cause long-term damage. So, inspect around the taps and around the connections to make sure that no water is leaking.
If you spot any water escaping, tighten the connections and nuts and try again. If water is still leaking, it might be time to call your  local plumber  – they may have to take it apart and start again. How to fit a kitchen tap with flexible hoses A flexible hose, otherwise known as a flexible tap connector, connects taps to the water supply. It’s useful for connecting taps in cramped areas.
Fitting a tap with flexible hoses is a fairly simple job, but one that requires specialist equipment and expertise. Here’s a quick overview of the typical kitchen tap installation process:
Preparation
Connecting the kitchen tap with flexible hoses
Fitting the tap
Connecting and testing How to fit a mixer tap in 6 quick steps Unsure of how to install a shower mixer tap? These tap types combine cold and hot water within the tap’s body. They do this using a single lever that rotates from left to right. Or they use individual cold and hot controls to ascertain the stream of cold and hot water.
Here’s a quick overview of how to fit a mixer tap:
Take away the old tap and remove the connection, then detach the nut (it’s hexagonal) that keeps the tap secure.
Remove your old taps and clean the area. Secure the tap tails so that they sit tightly in the tap’s frame.
Attach the fixing studs to the tap’s base. Place the tap above the countertop or sink’s tap hole. Next, pull the fixing studs and tap tails across them.
Affix a retaining plate and washer over the fixing studs from underneath the tap hole. Place nuts on the fixing studs.
Once the tap’s in the right position, use a spanner to screw in the nuts tightly. Be careful not to harm the sink, though.
Switch on the mains water supply to ensure no water can escape. If any water escapes, inspect the connectors, then adjust if necessary. How to fit bath taps Fitting a bathroom tap is fairly similar to fitting a kitchen tap. So, refer to the ‘how to fit a kitchen tap’ guidelines above for detailed instructions.
Before you start this task, take away the bath panel to remove and install the new bath taps.
Acrylic bath panels just slip into place. If not, find push on/off magnetic catches or screws that fasten the panel. It’s possible you might need to take off a section of the supporting structure to allow you to get underneath the bath.
First and foremost, you’ll need to know which bath tap you have. Usually, bath taps come in two types:
Pillar taps
 – two individual taps for cold and hot water.
Mixer taps
 – one individual tap that blends both cold and hot water. Typically, these include a shower fixture, too, often known as a bath shower mixer tap.
Other less-known bath tap choices include wall-mounted taps, valve-operated bath fillers, and freestanding taps. If you don’t know which tap type you have, it’s best to speak to a professional plumber.
Tools you’ll need:
New taps
A wrench
A back nut
A blowtorch and a solder (if you’re using copper piping to relink the water supply pipes)
Here’s a quick overview of the steps involved. Please note, the below steps relate to separate hot and cold taps (bath pillar taps), not mixer taps:
Prepare the area.
Turn off your water supply.
Unfasten the tap connectors.
Detach the bath tap.
Clean the area.
Check the condition of your fixings, pipes, and joins.
Put the new bath tap in place.
Install the connectors to your replacement bath tap.
Attach the connectors to your pipes (either using push-fit plastic fittings or copper piping).
Position the back nut.
Hand tighten the nut.
Repeat the previous step.
Install the flexible tap tails.
Switch on the water at the mains.
Make sure there aren’t any leaks.

Is it easy to fit a tap?
Removing and installing new taps isn’t always an easy job. Because water is involved, if you make a mistake, things can go wrong fast. So, be sure to follow the above six steps carefully.
If in doubt, we’d recommend leaving tap fitting to a  professional plumber .
How do I install a bathroom tap?
You can follow the six simple instructions mentioned above to install your bathroom tap.
Do all taps fit all basins?
Most taps are a standard size. So, it should be a case of being able to swap one set of taps for another, regardless of what basin you have. However, the size refers to how a tap fits into the pipework, not the overall size of the taps themselves.

Preparing your garden for the winter,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/winter-garden-preparation/,Garden,"Preparing your garden for the winter

In This Blog: Cut back certain flowers to the ground Protect seasonal plants by bringing them indoors Remove fallen leaves from the grass Tidy borders and add new soil Plant bulbs for next year Don’t forget your house plants FAQs The winter can play havoc on your garden if you’re not prepared. Don’t waste all the hard work you put into your garden during the spring and summer, make sure your garden is prepared for the seasonal change.
We spoke to the team at  Denham Gardeners  for their top tips on how to prep the garden for the winter, so that you can have a healthy garden all year round. Cut back certain flowers to the ground A lot of flowers will naturally come to the end of their bloom as the cold hits and it’s important to cut them back. Perennials, such as roses, will need to have their longer stems trimmed to stop them from snapping in any storms. Autumn-fruiting raspberries on the other hand will need to be cut down to within 5cm of the ground. It’s also a good time to cut back clematis, wisteria and any fruit bushes.
If you’re unsure on which plants need cutting back, then we recommend  hiring a professional gardener  as they will be able to advise you and make sure your plants are cut back to where they need to be. Protect seasonal plants by bringing them indoors Some plants are too fragile to withstand the winter chills, but that doesn’t mean they can’t make it through another year. It’s simply a case of potting them up and bringing them indoors into the warm.
This includes plants such as dahlias and gladiolus. As long as they are indoors away from the frost, they will be okay.
Speak to one of our gardening experts if you’re not sure which plants to bring in. Remove fallen leaves from the grass Fallen leaves from trees and bushes will need to be removed from the grass before a lot of rain or even snow, falls. If not, the leaves can end up suffocating the grass, causing damp patches and potentially mould and rotting.
This can be done using either a rake or leaf blower, with the leaves added to a compost pile to help create next year’s soil. Tidy borders and add new soil When the flowers aren’t big and in bloom, you have better access to work on your borders. It’s the perfect time to remove any weeds, dig up any old soil and add fresh layers of soil ready for the spring.
Not only will it be good for the health of your borders, but it will also make them tidy so that everything is easier to manage over the winter months because let’s face it, you want to be out in the cold as little as possible!
You don’t have to get your hands dirty though, you can either wear some gardening gloves or even easier, hire a gardener to come and do the work – then you’ll be safe in the knowledge that everything is being done properly. Plant bulbs for next year Winter may be nearing the end of the year, but it’s also a great opportunity for the start of something new. Now is a great time to plant bulbs for the springtime. Tulips, daffodils, pansies, bluebells and snowdrops are some of the most popular to plant for the spring. Don’t forget your house plants House plants will also need a little TLC in the colder months. Darker days mean less sunlight and warmth for your plants and so they will go into a dormant stage. Because of this, it’s important not to give them the same amount of water as you would in the summer. Other things you can do include:
Cleaning their leaves to remove any dust or dirt
Keeping them warm and away from any draughts
Putting them into light, preferably a conservatory if you have one

Find gardeners your neighbours recommend  FAQs When should I prepare my garden for winter?
The best time to make a start on preparing your garden for winter is November. You will want to start by getting your garden in order by clearing debris and making it as tidy as possible. Be careful not to over dig your soil though, it needs protection from the winter weather.
How do I get my garden ready for winter?
To get your garden ready for winter, follow the below checklist: Cut back certain flowers to the ground Protect seasonal plants by bringing them indoors Remove fallen leaves from the grass Tidy borders and add new soil Plant bulbs for next year If you’re struggling for time or you don’t feel confident in the garden winter prep, then one of our  gardening members  can help you.
Should I cover my garden in the winter?
Yes, you should cover your garden. Future you and your soil will thank you when you hit spring.
Covering your garden means it will halt those early spring weeds and protect those beneficial insects living inside the garden from frost and snow. You can do this by applying compost, or by applying compost and another cover for protection too. The nutrients in the compost will give a healthy boost through the chilly months ahead.
When should you till your garden?
The best time to till a garden is in the spring. This is when the soil is dry and the weather is taking a positive turn. So you could till as early as March, but some people decide to wait until May or June.

Garden room planning permission,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/garden-room-planning-permission/,Garden,"Garden room planning permission

In This Blog: Do I need planning permission for my garden room? How to get garden room planning permission Looking to build a garden room? How much does a garden room cost to be installed by a professional? FAQs One of the most common complaints by homeowners is the lack of space in their properties. One solution for this is to  add an extension , but this can be costly and time-consuming. An alternative option is to install a garden room.
In this guide, we’ll be taking a closer look at garden room planning permission, including when you need it, permitted development and the application process. Do I need planning permission for my garden room? The benefits of garden rooms are numerous, from extra living space to having a private sanctuary in your own garden. Generally, you won’t need planning permission for a garden room, but this isn’t always the case.
Garden rooms are classed as outbuildings and are often considered permitted development. However, there are certain circumstances where you’ll need permission to build your garden room. If your garden room falls into any of the below categories, then it’s likely you will need planning permission:
Your home is a listed building
You will be living in or operating a business from your garden room
Your new structure covers above 50% of your land
The garden room is at the front of your property
The structure has a raised platform or balcony
Your new outbuilding is more than one storey or 3 metres high
It has eaves that are over 2.5 metres high
For further guidance on garden room planning permission, take a look at the  outbuildings page  on Planning Portal’s website. In addition, if you’re at all confused about whether you need planning permission to build your garden room, we’d recommend contacting your local planning department.
What are the new rules for building in a back garden?
In 2020,  new permitted development rules  came into play that affects whether or not you need to apply for planning permission. Please note, these rules don’t apply to listed buildings, flats, and homes outside Britain. Generally, these rules apply to the size, position and use of your garden room, so make sure your new structure is:
Only one storey high
Less than 10 square metres big and more than 20 metres from your property if you live in a conservation area
Either more than 2 metres from your property boundary or less than 2.5 metres high
Not built to the front or side of your home if you live in a conservation area
Not located in your front garden
Not fitted with a microwave antenna

Find a local garden room specialist  How to get garden room planning permission If your planned structure falls into any of the above categories, you’ll need to apply for planning permission. The process isn’t too complex, although it can take weeks to get approval for your garden room, so factor this into your plans. To apply, you’ll need to fill out an application that goes to your local planning authority for approval. You can do this online through the  gov.uk website .
You will also need to think about building regulations. In certain situations, you may need to apply for this in addition to planning permission. Even if your garden room falls outside the requirement for building regulations, it’s well worth following these anyway to ensure your new structure is well built and insulated.
If your new outbuilding will be over 15 square metres, will be used for sleeping or is more than one metre from your property boundary, you’ll usually need to apply for building regulations approval. You can submit your application through the  gov.uk website . Looking to build a garden room? While you may be able to do some of the work yourself, we’d strongly recommend hiring a tradesperson for high-quality, long-lasting results. This is especially important for anything that requires you to work with electricity, gas or plumbing as this can be very risky.
So, how can you find the right person for your job? Well, the most important thing when undertaking any type of project is to find a team of professionals you can trust. At Checkatrade, our members pass through 12 checks to make sure you get the best possible service.
Just type your postcode into our  free search feature  to find a range of professionals recommended by your neighbours. We’re so confident about our members that we have introduced a  guarantee , which means if in the rare case anything does go wrong, we’ll give you up to £1,000 to put things right ( T&Cs  apply).
For further support when it comes to home improvements and finding the right worker for your job, check out the  HomeOwners Alliance  website. You’ll find handy guides and advice for a range of different projects. How much does a garden room cost to be installed by a professional? Once you’ve decided to hire a qualified professional to build your garden room, you may wonder how much this will cost. While building a garden room is generally cheaper than an extension, it’ll still cost an average of 
£2,650
 for a mini garden office, plus 
£690
 for assembly.
Of course, the larger the garden room, the more it’ll cost and for a big, log cabin style garden room you may pay up to 
£30,000
. For more prices and considerations, check out our  garden room cost guide. Once your garden room is installed, it may be worth investing in some new garden landscaping to further enhance your outside space. It can cost between 
£50 – £100
 for decking. To learn more, check out our  garden landscaping cost guide. 
Find a local garden room specialist  FAQs What is backland development?
Backland development applies to any structure built in your back garden. If you’re adding a structure then you’re conducting backland development.
How do I get planning permission to build a house in my garden?
If you plan to build a house in your garden, you’ll definitely need planning permission and building regulations approval. You can apply for these through the government website pages on  planning permission  and  building regulations. Which tradespeople should I use for the job?
There are a range of companies that provide garden rooms. However, if you want a garden room that perfectly suits your outside space and your requirements, it’s well worth building from scratch. To build a custom structure, you’ll need the help of different tradespeople.
To save you the time and energy of scrolling through search engines looking for electricians, builders, and other professionals, try our  request a quote feature . Simply give us the details of your project and we’ll send these to three professionals in your local area. They’ll either ask for more information or send you a quote. It couldn’t be easier!

How to install a Ring Doorbell,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/install-ring-doorbell/,Tag Not Found,"How to install a Ring Doorbell

In This Blog: How to install a Ring Doorbell How to install a Ring Doorbell on brick without drilling How to attach a Ring Doorbell to a uPVC door How to install a Ring Doorbell Pro with plug-in adapter How to set up a Ring Doorbell FAQs Ring Doorbells have become commonplace in homes across the UK, with the added security benefits an attractive feature for homeowners.
Wondering how to install a Ring Doorbell? Our guide will take you through the steps, with some top tips and FAQs too. You may also be considering automating your home fully. Check out our  home automation cost guide  for more information. How to install a Ring Doorbell As you’d expect for a globally recognised brand, a Ring Doorbell is a relatively easy product to install. Simply follow these steps:
Before starting the installation, fully charge the battery in your Ring Doorbell using the cable provided in the box. Your Ring Doorbell is fully charged when the light on the top glows green.
Remember to insert the fully charged battery into the bottom of your doorbell. It’s secure when you hear and feel a click.
Use the manual to check all of the parts needed for installation are in the box before you start.
You’ll need a screwdriver, and possibly a drill (make sure it’s fully charged if cordless), pencil and hammer depending on the model you’ve bought and the mounting method you choose. Be sure to use a pencil instead of a pen, in case you need to reposition the doorbell before drilling.
Give yourself an hour for the job and ideally do it on a dry day.
Top tip: If you’re at all unsure about how and where to drill, we recommend
 hiring a handyperson
 to take the job off your hands. Find out how much  doorbell installation costs . How to install a Ring Doorbell on brick without drilling Whether you live in a rented property and are worried about potential repairs, you don’t have a drill, or you simply don’t want to drill into your brickwork, here’s how to install a Ring Doorbell without drilling:
Find the no-drill mount in the Ring Doorbell box. The no-drill mount will have double-sided adhesive on the back.
Choose your Ring Doorbell’s location, ideally around 48 inches from the ground.
Hold the no-drill mount in the location you want it, make sure it’s level and make a mark on the wall in pencil.
Remove the covering on the adhesive, line up with your pencil mark and press firmly against the brick wall.
Ensure the mount is firmly attached to the wall by holding it with pressure for two minutes.
Line up your Ring Doorbell and screw it into the no-drill mount plate.
Push on the faceplate and secure using the security screw on the underside.
Your Ring Doorbell installation is complete.

Find local Ring doorbell installers recommended by your neighbours  How to attach a Ring Doorbell to a uPVC door There are two ways to install your Ring Doorbell if you’re planning on attaching it to a uPVC door frame:
Installing your Ring Doorbell without screwing into the uPVC
Find the no-drill mount in the box, take off the strip covering the adhesive on the back and stick to your uPVC frame where you want the doorbell to be located. This should be around 48 inches up from the ground.
Hold with some pressure for two minutes to ensure the mount is firmly stuck to the uPVC frame.
Line your Ring Doorbell up and use the screws included to attach it to the mount.
Pop the faceplate on and tighten the security screw underneath the unit.
Good to know:
 If you ever need to remove the no-drill mount, find the two tapes behind the top of the mount and pull both upwards together. How to install a Ring Doorbell Pro with plug-in adapter If you’ve gone for the Ring Doorbell Pro, then your installation will require the use of a plug socket in order to run a cable to power the doorbell unit. Here’s how to hardwire a Ring Doorbell and install a Ring Doorbell Pro:
First of all, locate the nearest usable socket to where the doorbell will be located. Don’t plug the adapter in yet.
Run the cable to the Ring Doorbell unit location and attach it to your wall along the way using the clips you’ll find in the box.
Take the cable through the wall to the rear of your doorbell.
Once you’ve done this, you need to install your doorbell as with any Ring model. If you don’t have a plug socket in place, we recommend getting an  electrician  in to do this for you.
Installing a Ring Doorbell Pro using a drill:
Click the included level tool into the front, just underneath the camera.
Choose where you want your Ring Doorbell to be located. This should be around 48 inches from the ground.
Line up your doorbell on the wall or door frame and ensure it’s completely level using the level tool.
Mark the surface behind using the mounting holes and a pencil.
Drill holes and insert the plastic anchors.
Secure the cable into the back of the doorbell.
Line up the doorbell and secure with the included screws.
Place on the faceplate and secure with the included security screw.
Installing a Ring Doorbell pro without using a drill:
Stick the no-drill mount in the box to your wall surface or door frame, 48 inches up from the ground.
Hold with pressure for two minutes.
Secure the cable into the back of the doorbell.
Line your Ring Doorbell up and attach it to the mount.
Add the faceplate and security screw underneath.
Then simply plug in, turn on and start using your Ring Doorbell. How to set up a Ring Doorbell With your Ring Doorbell installed, you now need to set it up. This is fairly simple and requires you to have a smartphone and wifi. Follow these steps:
Download the Ring app from the App Store or Play Store.
You’ll need to log in or create an account.
Find the QR code or MAC ID barcode on your Ring device or on the packaging and scan it using your phone.
Enter your geographical location and name your device.
Connect your doorbell to the Ring wifi network and to your wifi network
Test your Ring Doorbell and you’re good to go!

Find local Ring doorbell installers recommended by your neighbours  FAQs Is a Ring Doorbell easy to install?
Compared to other home security and convenience installations, a Ring Doorbell is easy to install. It should take around an hour and requires basic tools. That said, if you’re at all unsure or don’t have the right tools, we recommend  hiring a professional  to do the job properly.
Does a Ring Doorbell require wiring?
The standard Ring Doorbell is completely wireless, using a rechargeable battery for power and wifi for a network. The Ring Doorbell Pro is a wired model, requiring a hardwired cable to be connected for a constant power supply. You will need to hire an  electrician  for this.
What’s needed to install a Ring Doorbell?
This depends based on the model you go for. With a standard Ring Doorbell, you’ll either need a screwdriver and a drill, or just a screwdriver if using the no-drill mount. If you’re installing a Ring Doorbell Pro, you’ll need the same again depending on your install, plus a hammer to secure the power cable to your walls.

How to make your garden more private,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/make-your-garden-more-private/,Garden,"How to make your garden more private

In This Blog: Top tips on how to make your garden more private Landscaping ideas to block neighbours Are there any restrictions concerning garden privacy? FAQs Expert help to make your garden more private Your garden is your personal outdoor space, a natural sanctuary to enjoy and relax in, so it’s understandable that you’d want to make it as private as possible.
There are a number of things you can do to improve the privacy of your garden and prevent neighbours from being able to see into your outdoor space. We’ll take a look at them in this guide and answer some common questions on how to make a garden more private. Top tips on how to make your garden more private If you feel your garden is overlooked by neighbours, there are a number of things you can do to make your garden more private.
You can start by erecting fences to the maximum height, which in the UK is 2m or 6’6”. There are a range of fence designs to choose from that are attractive for both you and your neighbours to look at, so don’t feel you have to go for a basic wall-like appearance.
If this isn’t enough, you can go higher than this, but you’ll need  planning permission  from your local authority.
Planting hedges or small trees along the edges of your outdoor area is a great, natural way of making an overlooked garden more private. Although these may start small, they will grow to create a complete screen, preventing neighbours from seeing into your garden. They’re also great for wildlife, such as birds and insects. Landscaping ideas to block neighbours Beyond fences and hedges, garden screening from neighbours can be achieved through landscaping. This could include stonework,  pergolas ,  water features , and permitted buildings that screen the fence lines between you and your neighbours.
We recommend contacting a professional  landscaper  to create your perfect private garden. They will know the best ways to get the most out of your space with the best privacy techniques that will complement your existing space. Are there any restrictions concerning garden privacy? When trying to make your garden more private you just need to be aware that in the UK, you can’t erect a fence higher than 2m, or 6’6”, without planning permission from your local authority.
You also need to keep any fast-growing shrubs on your garden’s borders down to 2m as well. This is because hedges comprising two or more evergreens are regulated by the Anti-Social Behaviour Act (2003) and if your neighbour feels you are in breach of this law, they can report you to the police.
Keep these regulations in mind, but also just think about keeping a good relationship with your neighbours. Tell them what you’re planning on doing and why, keep them in the loop and sell the benefits of a private garden to them, too!

Find a landscaper that your neighbours recommend  FAQs How can I stop my neighbours from overlooking my garden?
The reality is, in most cases, your neighbours won’t want to be overlooking your garden, but that doesn’t stop you from wanting to prevent it. If a neighbour is overlooking your garden from a low-level, then fences to the maximum 2m height are a great idea, as well as shrubs and trees such as beech and japonica.
If your neighbours are higher up, consider bamboo or a pergola with a rambling rose on top to screen you from above.
How can I make my garden private faster?
Fences are probably the fastest way to establish garden screening from neighbours in the UK. But there are also a range of fast-growing bushes and low-level trees you can plant, such as:
Arborvitae
Cherry Laurel
Bay Laurel
Privet
Leylandii
Bamboo
While these won’t do the job overnight, you’ll see significant screening after a year of growth.
How do I block out my neighbour’s view?
This depends on where they are viewing your garden from. If it’s from an elevated position, then consider a pergola over a patio, or fast-growing shrubs around the edge of your outdoor area.
If it’s from ground-level, go for a maximum 2m metre fence and maybe consider growing a shrub up the fence to ramble over the top and make the dividing line between your two properties look more attractive.
Do I have a right to privacy in my garden?
There aren’t any laws that entitle you to privacy in your garden in the UK. However, there are regulations around nuisance that can be enforced, including noise, smoke from a BBQ and excessive lighting.
The Noise Act 1996 makes it easier for you to stop loud, disruptive music or a dog barking, particularly between the hours of 11 pm – 7 am.
How high can you have screening in your garden?
Current laws allow for garden screening from neighbours in the UK to be 2m, or 6’6”, high, including fences, trees, shrubs and bushes along a boundary line.
You can go higher with planning permission from your local authority, but be aware that your neighbours will be asked to comment on the application. Expert help to make your garden more private When it comes to boundary lines in your garden, there are a number of risks, both legally and relationship-wise to consider. It’s always best to seek the advice of a professional on what’s possible on your property.
Getting the help of an experienced landscaper or garden privacy specialist will also enable you to achieve privacy and a beautiful garden that you’ll love being in. And that’s the whole point of privacy in the first place!

How to install a dishwasher,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/install-dishwasher/,Kitchen,"How to install a dishwasher

In This Blog: How to plumb in a dishwasher How to connect a dishwasher and washing machine to one waste pipe How to fit an integrated dishwasher How to fit an integrated dishwasher door How to install a tabletop dishwasher How to fit a dishwasher in a small kitchen Do you need a plumber to install a dishwasher? How to find a trustworthy expert How much does a dishwasher cost to be installed by a professional? Which tradespeople should you use for the job? Dishwashers are no longer just a luxury item. They have become a key component in many homes throughout the country. Not only that, they’ve single-handedly stopped the argument of who’s washing up and who’s drying!
Now that dishwashers are as much standard in a property as a washing machine, it does mean that when your dishwasher suddenly stops working, you need it to be repaired or replaced as quickly as possible. Learning how to install a new dishwasher may be essential to keep your home running efficiently.
This article is perfect whether your dishwasher has broken down, you’re buying your first dishwasher, or you just want to upgrade to a shiny new model.
Keep reading if you’re looking for steps on installing a new dishwasher. Repairing a dishwasher is another story, so we recommend that you check our  dishwasher repair costs . 
We would always recommend getting a professional to quote for the repair. It’s worth finding out first-hand if your appliance is 
worth repairing.
Before beginning, gather the following tools:
Bucket
Spanner
Screwdriver
Towels to mop up any drips

Find plumbers trusted by your neighbours  How to plumb in a dishwasher Ok, now you have everything to hand, use the below steps to install a dishwasher:
Start by turning off the water supply to your dishwasher. There may be a stopcock you can turn next to the appliance, but if not, you’ll need to switch off your mains water supply.
If you’re replacing an old machine, make sure to slowly pull it away from the wall. You can then unplug the electricity supply.
Position a bucket underneath the pipes and carefully detach the waste hose from the drainage pipe.
Detach the cold-water supply from your dishwasher hose, again using a bucket to catch the drips. You can then move the old dishwasher out of the area you are working in.
Slide your new dishwasher towards its planned location.
Next, join the cold-water supply to the dishwasher cold water hose. Make sure this is properly tightened using a spanner. At this point, you can open the cold-water valve again.
Attach the drainage pipe to your new appliance’s waste hose. You’ll need to tighten the clip using a screwdriver.
Plug the dishwasher into a power socket and switch your mains water supply back on.
Test that there are no leaks or issues by running a dishwasher cycle.
Top tip: If there is a leak that you cannot fix, now is a good time to call in a plumber.
Finally, slide the dishwasher into its new position.
Perfect, you now know how to plumb in a dishwasher.
Get help if you need it.

Find plumbers trusted by your neighbours  How to connect a dishwasher and washing machine to one waste pipe It’s very common for kitchens in the UK to have more than one appliance, making light work of dull household chores. To save time and space, it’s possible to learn how to install a dishwasher and washing machine together. If this is something you are considering, why not check out our guide on  how to connect a dishwasher and washing machine to one waste pipe ?
With advice and tips, this article covers the most important steps to plumb these machines together. Plus, you’ll find guidance on common kitchen issues like draining a washing machine and how to extend a drain hose.
On the other hand, if you want to learn to install a washing machine separately, please see our  how to plumb in a washing machine guide. How to fit an integrated dishwasher The main difference between fitting a dishwasher and an integrated dishwasher is that the latter has a few extra steps to fix it in place. To fit an integrated dishwasher, use the above step-by-step guide to plumb in your dishwasher, then use the below tips to finish the installation:
Once your dishwasher is connected, ensure it’s at the right height and level with your worktops. You can usually adjust the feet of your appliance to alter the height.
Attach the clips that came with your integrated dishwasher to the surfaces surrounding the machine. Please note, you may need to use a screwdriver.
Finally, slide your dishwasher in place and ensure the clips engage. How to fit an integrated dishwasher door One of the best ways to seamlessly blend your dishwasher into your kitchen is to add an integrated dishwasher door. These doors are fitted in front of your appliance, blocking it from view and creating the illusion that it’s just another cupboard.
If you have an integrated dishwasher and want to learn how to fit an integrated dishwasher door, use the following tips:
The first step is to buy a door that works well in your kitchen. You can either pick a door that matches the rest of your kitchen cupboards or select another finish that fits with your design scheme.
Your door will come with a fixing plate (the surface that sits between your dishwasher and the integrated door). You’ll need to use a pencil to mark where the metal connectors and door rollers need to be attached to the fixing plate.
You can then attach the door rollers and connection pieces.
Once everything is tightly screwed into place, you can slide the integrated door onto the rollers.
Finally, attach any remaining fixings to hold the door in place. How to install a tabletop dishwasher Tabletop dishwashers work in a similar way to standard dishwashers. They’re just smaller and designed to sit on your worktop instead of underneath. You need to connect a tabletop dishwasher using the method outlined earlier in this guide. In addition, you could consider installing your tabletop dishwasher in a kitchen cupboard to save worktop space. How to fit a dishwasher in a small kitchen If your kitchen is on the small side, you may think you don’t have space for a dishwasher. While you may be correct, there are ways of fitting a dishwasher into a small kitchen. Before you give up, consider the following options:
Install a dishwasher under your sink
Choose a slimline or tabletop dishwasher
Position a dishwasher at the end of your row of cabinets Do you need a plumber to install a dishwasher? The answer to this question will depend on your circumstances. Replacing an old dishwasher like for like can be done by anyone with a little DIY experience, although this may be challenging for some. On the other hand, installing new pipework is more complex, and we would advise seeking the assistance of a plumber in this scenario. How to find a trustworthy expert Although this guide should help to simplify how to install a dishwasher, you may find yourself struggling, especially if you’re a DIY beginner. We’d always recommend hiring a professional rather than risk making costly mistakes. For example, a leak could cause mould and rotten floorboards if not dealt with promptly.
So, how do you find someone you can trust for this job? Well, why not try our  online search engine ? We thoroughly check our members, giving you the confidence you’re hiring someone qualified and experienced to install your dishwasher.

How to lay vinyl flooring in 5 steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/lay-vinyl-flooring/,Bathroom,"How to lay vinyl flooring in 5 steps

In This Blog: Top tips on how to lay your vinyl flooring How to lay vinyl flooring in a bathroom in 5 steps How to lay vinyl flooring in the kitchen FAQs about laying vinyl flooring answered Ensure a professional finish for your vinyl floor If you’re here then you’re thinking about how to lay vinyl flooring yourself. It’s possible, but it requires the right tools, plenty of time and attention to detail.
In this guide, we’ll cover top tips on how to lay vinyl flooring and look specifically at laying vinyl flooring in a bathroom and a kitchen. We’ll also answer your vinyl flooring questions! Top tips on how to lay your vinyl flooring If you’re considering laying a vinyl floor yourself then we’ve got a number of top tips to help you get it right the first time. You only have one shot at cutting and laying!
Measure twice, cut once
This has never been truer than when laying a vinyl floor. Make sure you double or even triple-check the m2 of your room.
To do this measure the length and width and multiply them, ensuring you measure the longest sections (in non-square spaces).
Add 10% of vinyl when ordering – for cuts and wastage
Whether you’re ordering your vinyl flooring online or in-person, you’ll be asked for your area in m2. Ensure you add 10% to the total area to allow for wastage and mistakes.
This is crucial as planks and pieces will need to be cut, which can result in unusable pieces.
Get the right vinyl-cutting tools
Whether you hire them or buy them, you’ll need the right tools in order to cut your vinyl flooring efficiently and accurately without rough edges or mistakes.
For vinyl rolls of flooring, you’ll want a very sharp stanley knife and a long metal ruler or piece of timber to give you a straight line. For tougher vinyl planks, you’ll need a saw, either a fine-blade handheld one, or an electric circular model. You’ll also need a bolster chisel to get vinyl sheeting firmly into your room’s corners.
Always lay vinyl flooring on a flat surface
The last thing you want when you’ve spent all of your time, effort and money measuring, cutting and buying your dream vinyl floor is for it to be bumpy, uneven and even creaky underfoot.
How to lay vinyl flooring on plywood – step by step
It’s always advisable to lay plywood over floorboards first and screed an uneven concrete floor in order to achieve a perfectly level surface for your vinyl flooring.
Simply cut your plywood sheets to fit the size and shape of your room and lay them in place, secured with small tack nails.
Then take your roll of vinyl or vinyl planks and begin laying from one corner, allowing for enough to go under skirting boards if necessary.
With almost all vinyl flooring you don’t need a layer of underlay between the plywood and the vinyl.
Factor in the pattern when laying vinyl planks
It’s not a consideration if you’re laying a roll of vinyl flooring, but if you’re putting down vinyl planks that resemble timber flooring, then you need to ensure the joints are staggered.
This ensures rigidity and strength in the flooring, just like in a brick wall, minimising the chance of uplift. It also looks more attractive and realistic.
Laying vinyl sheeting in corners
When it comes to laying in corners, you’ll need to get the vinyl to be as flat on the floor as possible in order to cut accurately.
For an internal corner, cut a triangular notch starting 3-4 inches along each side and meeting in the middle. For external corners, go from the edge of the vinyl down to the sub-base or floor with a straight cut. Then trim, but leave 10cm turned up if going under skirting.
There’s a lot to learn and get right if you’re considering laying a vinyl floor for the first time. And mistakes can be costly, not always showing themselves straight away.
To get quotes from vinyl  flooring professionals  recommended by your neighbours, simply enter your postcode below.

How to lay vinyl flooring on floorboards
Whether you’re wondering how to lay vinyl flooring on wood or floorboards, the same considerations apply.
No matter if they’re brand new or hundreds of years old, floorboards are not perfectly level. The gaps between the boards will show through vinyl flooring and potentially create weak points where damage can occur. This can result in the need for  vinyl flooring repair , which can be expensive.
The solution is to place a thin layer of plywood down first on top of the floorboards, secured with some short, flat head nails. This creates a perfectly level surface across your entire room, which you can then lay your vinyl flooring on top of as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
For an extra layer of springiness in your vinyl flooring, you can place a thin foam layer between the plywood and the flooring. This can also help to keep your vinyl flooring in place, although in most cases this is not needed.
How to cut your vinyl roll or sheeting
Using the right tools, as mentioned earlier, press your vinyl as far into the angle where your wall or skirting meets your floor or sub base. Use the bolster chisel to do this effectively and create a crease.
Then using your metal ruler or timber, push it up against the crease and cut carefully to achieve the perfect finish to your room edge. How to lay vinyl flooring in a bathroom in 5 steps First, you’ll need to remove as many items as you can from the room, and while it may not be possible to move the bath, sink or toilet, it’s advisable to clear all moveable furniture.
You might also want to remove the skirting boards to enable you to lay your flooring all the way to the walls for a professional-looking finish.
As your bathroom is potentially the wettest room in your house, the first thing to do when you get access to the floorboards is to seal any large holes or gaps.
After sealing gaps, you can lay down plywood and a layer of screed to really create a water-tight base right up to the walls. Just be aware that, while this is ideal for a vinyl underbase, it does mean that your underfloor pipework will be less accessible if you have a leak. If you’re concerned about this, just go with the plywood.
Then lay your vinyl flooring on top, fitting it around each element of your suite using accurate measurements and the right cutting tools. With vinyl sheeting, use spray adhesive or double-sided sticky tape around the edges to secure in place.
How to lay vinyl flooring around a toilet
Lay your vinyl flooring as close as you can to where the toilet pan meets the floor. As you get to the pan, if you have a roll of vinyl flooring lay it right up and around as much as you can and, giving yourself a couple of inches of excess, mark with a pen the shape of the pan on the flooring ensuring you leave enough vinyl around to reach the nearby walls.
You can then cut knowing that it will overlap the pan. This is fine, as you can then trim more easily back down to the actual shape around the pan to get a great finish.
If you’re laying vinyl planks, lay as close as you can, then offer them up to the pan and mark the cutting shape on them, leaving an inch or more too much on the plank. You can then trim back more easily for an accurate fit around the pan. How to lay vinyl flooring in the kitchen To lay vinyl flooring in a kitchen you first need to measure the total area you want to floor. In a kitchen this is particularly important, as you’ll need to decide whether you’re just going up to the kitchen units, or will floor under them as well. This will impact your total  kitchen vinyl flooring cost  as more flooring will be needed. 
Remember to measure right up to the walls, if you’ll be removing skirting boards.
With your total m2 (+10% for wastage/mistakes), you can buy your vinyl flooring. Remember to buy the same m2 of thin plywood sheets too, and small tack nails, in order to create a level surface over your floorboards.
With everything on-site, get back to the floorboards, seal any gaps in the floor, and lay your plywood without any space between, going right into every corner. Then bring in your vinyl flooring, whether plank or roll.
Begin laying from one corner, remembering that although your walls may look perfectly straight, they might not be. So offer up the vinyl to the corner and see if the wall is flush or heads away or into it. Cut appropriately. 
With vinyl planks, remember to stagger to create a strong and natural look, like with a brick wall. This may mean cutting some.
Continue laying the vinyl until the floor is covered. With planks, there’s usually no need to glue them to your sub-base. With vinyl sheeting, simply lift the edge and use spray adhesive or double-sided sticky tape to secure.
How to lay vinyl flooring over tiles
If your kitchen has floor tiles then you can still lay vinyl flooring, you just need to ensure that the surface is level. Take a look for any deep grout lines, cracks or broken tiles, and fill in, as you’ll feel all of these through your new vinyl floor covering. FAQs about laying vinyl flooring answered Do you need underlay for vinyl flooring?
In almost all cases, no. Vinyl flooring is designed to go straight onto plywood or a similar sub base. When it comes to establishing how to lay vinyl flooring on concrete, this is where the exception exists.
When you’re laying vinyl click flooring on a concrete floor you may need a layer in between, as movement can occur. In this situation, you can lay a thin foam underlay for grip.
Should vinyl flooring be glued down?
Vinyl sheeting or roll should be glued using adhesive.
Slightly different, vinyl planks gain their strength and steadfastness from the clicking connections. They do not need glueing down.
What do you put down before vinyl flooring?
As discussed in this guide, it’s important to create a completely flat and level surface before laying vinyl flooring. In most cases, this means adding a layer of thin plywood on top of your floorboards, secured with small tack nails.
Beyond this, you can place a thin layer of foam underlay down if you want a springier feel underfoot, but this generally isn’t needed.
How do you start laying vinyl flooring?
Laying a vinyl floor that will be pleasant to look at and last a long time begins with preparation of the room and purchase or hire of the right tools. All listed above.
First, you need to level the floor using plywood sheets. Then offer up your flooring to the room, starting in one corner. When cutting, remember to allow extra to go under skirting boards if they are still in place.
Make cuts that track the wall using the advice in our top tips section above and then lay your vinyl flooring across the room. This is the best way to start laying vinyl flooring yourself. Ensure a professional finish for your vinyl floor You’ll be looking at and walking on your vinyl floor for years to come, so you’ll want it to be right first time. Particularly as an inferior job will show quickly and cost significant time and money to put right.

Finding the best furniture for your rental property,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/best-furniture-for-rental-property/,"Kitchen, Living Room","Finding the best furniture for your rental property

In This Blog: The do’s and don’ts for picking the best furniture for your rental property Most durable flooring for a rental property How to keep rental property maintenance manageable FAQs for choosing the best furniture for a rental property As a landlord choosing the best furniture for your rental property is one of the key factors to making your rental a success. In this blog, we look at the main ways you can make your rental property attractive, durable and easy to maintain. The do’s and don’ts for picking the best furniture for your rental property Do
Install a good quality kitchen and bathroom that’s easy to clean
Provide enough lighting
Choose furniture and flooring that will stand up to wear and tear.
The kitchen and bathroom are the two spaces that will get the most use, so it is important to focus on these when choosing the best furniture for your rental property.
Whether you’re installing new fixtures and fittings or renovating an existing property for rental, investing in quality will serve you and your tenants best in the long run. 
For more in-depth information and costings check out our 
kitchen renovation 
and 
bathroom remodel 
cost guides
.
No one wants to live in a house that’s gloomy. To keep your rental property looking bright and inviting, make sure you have enough socket-outlets for lamps, or consider  investing in downlights .
If you need to add additional sockets then this is a simple job for a local  electrician .
Don’t
Include family heirlooms, antiques or sentimental items
Struggle on with old doors and windows
Dismiss including second-hand furniture
To avoid complaints from tenants, make sure that doors and windows are in good working order. An  internal door  could cost you as little as £60 to replace. By ensuring your  window seals , lock and glazing are in the best condition you not only provide peace of mind but can also keep your energy bills lower.
When it comes to providing the best furniture for your rental property, you can’t overlook soft furnishings and staple pieces such as tables and chairs. Most tenants will expect these items to be in situ for the start of their tenancy agreement but some may choose to bring their own.
If you are providing these pieces of furniture, it can be tempting to choose inexpensive pieces but as the old saying goes, “if you buy cheap, you buy twice”. If your budget is really tight then it can be worth hunting for decent second-hand pieces and getting this  furniture refurbished .
Alternatively, if your rental property is a longer-term investment that you plan to keep in your family, you could also consider  bespoke carpentry  for furniture that is unique to your rental.
Ultimately the best furniture for your rental property is the kind that you can afford to maintain. Most durable flooring for a rental property Carpet is definitely the most common flooring found in rental property’s but it is not the most hardwearing. With this in mind, if you’re looking for the most durable home flooring then it is wise to avoid carpet in high traffic areas such as hallways and the living and dining room.
As alternatives you could consider: Laminate flooring Vinyl flooring Engineered hardwood Laminate flooring is cost-effective and incredibly versatile, as well as being easy to clean, which makes it a great option for durable flooring for a rental property. Take a look at our  laminate flooring cost guide  for more information.
Similarly, vinyl flooring is also very affordable, as well as being water-resistant. This makes vinyl flooring a great option for kitchens and bathrooms where laminate flooring is not recommended. Vinyl comes in a huge range of designs and it is easy to maintain and clean, making it one of the most durable home flooring options. Get an idea of costs with our  vinyl floor cost guide  – if you like vinyl but you would quite like an even stronger option,  luxury vinyl  is another great option!
Engineered hardwood is the most durable flooring for a rental property but it does come at a cost. Unlike a traditional hardwood floor, engineered hardwood consists of several layers of plywood or fibreboard with a very thin layer of hardwood veneer on the top.
These layers make engineered hardwood a lot more stable than full hardwood floors as it reduces problems associated with moisture, warping and swelling that come with a traditional hardwood floor.
For the best advice and guidance for the most durable home flooring for your rental property, consult with a flooring expert who can provide you with quotes for all the suitable options.

Find flooring specialists your neighbours recommend  How to keep rental property maintenance manageable Whichever fixtures and fittings you choose, there is no getting away from the fact that as a landlord there will always be things to maintain. To keep rental property maintenance manageable we recommend:
Keep up with routine checks
 – Ask your tenants how things are, don’t wait for them to complain or raise issues. Book in regular visits with your tenants to check that everything is in order.
Choose quality fittings
 – Keeping costs down is important but consider the lifespan of your furniture and fittings and invest in longevity.
Budget for repairs
 – Set aside a portion of the rental income for repairs and upgrades, or cleaning between tenants.
Garden maintenance
 – If you have a garden space, set out in your rental agreement who will maintain the area.Usually tenants maintain a garden, but as the landlord you need to provide the tools for them to do so, e.g. a lawnmower. If you are very particular about your garden then you might want to opt for  hiring a gardener . FAQs for choosing the best furniture for a rental property What does a landlord have to provide in a furnished flat?
As a bare minimum, a landlord needs to provide a place to do laundry, food preparation, and food storage. Typically in a furnished rental property you would expect to find:
4-ring hob with oven and grill.
Cooker hood or extractor fan.
Fridge and freezer, or a fridge-freezer.
Microwave oven.
Suitable and adequate kitchen cupboards for storing food.
Sink with mains water supply of cold potable water, piped supply of hot water and draining area.
Most furnished apartments include a couch, coffee and end tables, a dining room table and chairs, beds, and basic kitchen appliances. Some (but not all) may include some extras like floor or table lamps, a toaster, a microwave, and basic cookware.
Who is responsible for the maintenance of a rental property?
A landlord has to do anything that is set out in the tenancy agreement. Landlords are also generally responsible for keeping in repair:
The structure and exterior of the property including the walls, roof, foundations, drains, guttering, external pipes, windows and external doors.
Basins, sinks, baths, toilets and their pipework.
Water and gas pipes, electrical wiring, water tanks, boilers, radiators, gas fires, fitted electric fires or fitted heaters.
These repair responsibilities can’t be removed or overwritten by clauses in a tenancy agreement. Landlord’s are also not permitted to pass on the cost of any repair work to tenants

How easy is it to rip out a kitchen for a kitchen refit?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/kitchen-refit/,Kitchen,"How easy is it to rip out a kitchen for a kitchen refit?

In This Blog: Planning a kitchen refit Step-by-step: how to rip out a kitchen How to remove a kitchen worktop Kitchen drawer removal  How to remove kitchen cabinets How to dispose of your old kitchen How much does a kitchen refit cost?  FAQs A kitchen renovation is not the cheapest job, but there are ways to save time and money when refitting your kitchen.
The best way to do this is by removing your kitchen carefully so that you can reuse and recycle parts of it. Read on for our tips on how to remove a kitchen for a refit. Planning a kitchen refit Before your new kitchen can be installed, you will first need to remove your existing one. Granted, this is not the most exciting part of the project, but there are ways to use this opportunity to save money 
and
 materials.
In this post, we’ll guide you through how to rip out a kitchen, including:
Removing kitchen cabinets
Removing a kitchen worktop
Removing kitchen drawers Step-by-step: how to rip out a kitchen First things first, gas, water, and electrical fixtures need to be shut off before you begin to rip out your kitchen. It’s helpful to clearly mark these fixtures too. You should contact a professional tradesperson to disconnect any gas appliances.
With these utility supplies safely shut off, you can remove kitchen appliances such as the washing machine, oven, and fridge, and begin to rip out the kitchen units. How to remove a kitchen worktop A kitchen worktop is normally fixed to the top of the cabinets with screws.
Remove any drawers or items within the cabinets to provide easy access.
You will then be able to identify and unscrew the fixings along the underside of the worktop.
Next, carefully cut the sealant between the worktop and the wall or tiles.
It should now be possible to lift the worktop away. You may need an extra pair of hands at this point depending on the size of the worktop and what it’s made from!
If you have tiles on the wall above your worktop it may be necessary to remove the bottom row before the worktop can be taken off. Use a hammer and bolster to do this. 
Remember to wear safety goggles and thick gloves.
If your worktop has been glued to the cabinets, gently use a chisel or utility knife to cut any adhesive or caulking. Next, use a small pry bar to carefully pry the worktop away from the cabinets.
Kitchen drawer removal 
With your worktop removed, you can now remove the kitchen drawers.
Make sure your kitchen drawers are empty.
Open the drawer so it’s fully extended on its runners.
Feel for the drawer adjustments. These can be found on either side of the drawer, either under a cover on each side of the drawer or underneath the drawer (on the outer edge).
Once you’ve located the drawer adjustments, lift the levers on either side (or push the lever up if it’s underneath the drawer), and pull the drawer out, off its runners. How to remove kitchen cabinets After you’ve removed the kitchen drawers, begin removing the cabinets.
Cabinet doors
First, remove the doors from the cabinets.
The easiest way to do this is to check for a release clip. This is a tab on the back of the hinge. Press the tab in and the hinge will release from the cabinet.
If there’s no release clip, simply unscrew the hinges from the cabinet.
Remember to support the weight of the door as it comes away.
Cabinets: base units and wall units
Before removing the kitchen cabinets, make sure they’re empty and take out any internal shelves.
Base units will be fitted to the wall and adjoining cabinets using fixings and screws. Therefore it’s just a case of unscrewing the cabinets from each other, and then from the wall itself. Then simply lift the cabinet out.
When removing wall cabinets, first unscrew the cabinets from each other.
Next, look for the wall fixings. These will be located at the top and bottom, either inside or outside of the cabinet.
Unscrew the wall fixings while someone supports the weight of the cabinet as it releases from the wall.
Top tip: Hire a professional to remove your kitchen so that you can be sure it’s being removed properly. This way, you have a better chance of reusing and reselling it. How to dispose of your old kitchen An important part of planning a kitchen refit is what you’ll do with the old units and appliances.
Reuse
Your existing appliances such as your fridge, oven and washing machine could be given a new lease of life with a professional clean and service. Not only will this be cheaper than buying new ones, but it will also help reduce the waste from your refit too.
Find an  appliance repair specialist  near you and click to find an  oven cleaner  near you.
Recycle
Provided you have removed your kitchen carefully (if you don’t know where to start, we recommend getting a helping hand in) then you can recycle different parts of your kitchen such as your worktops, cabinets and sink.
You can list the items on a website such as Freecycle, eBay or even Facebook Marketplace. You’ll be surprised at what can be reused by someone else, preventing your old kitchen from going into landfill.
Skip
If your kitchen is beyond saving and disposal is your only option, then you may need to hire a skip. Here’s our guide to  skip hire prices .
How much does a kitchen refit cost? 
The average cost to fit a new kitchen is 
£1,500
. This cost is for labour only and is based on an average-sized family kitchen.
When planning your kitchen renovation, bear in mind the following factors will impact the overall cost:
The size of the kitchen being fitted
The area to be tiled (walls and floor)
The cost of the new units and appliances
Where you live
Plastering, plasterboarding, or refinishing before the new kitchen is fitted
Other costs to plan for:
Removal and disposal of existing units and appliances
Individual trades required for removing gas appliances, fitting electrics, or making alterations to mains services (water, gas, and waste)
Structural work, if needed
Finishing and decoration
Take a look at our guide on the  cost of a kitchen refit , or take a look at  how much a new kitchen costs . If you’re looking for inspiration, check out our  kitchen ideas . FAQs How long does it take to rip out a kitchen?
Expect this part of your project to take a day or two.
How long does it take to fit a kitchen?
Fitting a kitchen can take around 10 working days, depending on the size of the kitchen to be fitted and any other work involved, as outlined above.
How do I dispose of old kitchen units?
The best way to dispose of old kitchen units is to recycle them. What you may no longer need could be just the ticket for someone else’s home renovation project. Therefore consider putting your old kitchen units and appliances on free selling or recycling sites such as Freecycle or Facebook Marketplace.

The benefits of changing the direction of a staircase,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/changing-staircase-direction/,Tag Not Found,"The benefits of changing the direction of a staircase

In This Blog: The benefits of changing the direction of a staircase Materials and type of staircase Repositioning a staircase Reversing the staircase direction Is changing a staircase expensive? FAQs Changing the direction of a staircase might not be as tricky, or expensive, as you might think.
Read on to find out how repositioning a staircase can make a big difference to the look and feel of your home. The benefits of changing the direction of a staircase When planning the interior layout of our homes, we often think about knocking down walls or extending the footprint, but have you considered moving the stairs?
Reversing the staircase direction could really open up the downstairs of your home. While repositioning the staircase could create more floor space and allow more light in.
Changing your staircase direction offers many benefits. It can: 
Open up the downstairs of your home
Allow more daylight in
Improve the layout of an awkward-shaped room
Make better use of the space available
Make a design statement
Make the stairs less steep Increase the value of your home Materials and type of staircase When considering changing the staircase direction, it’s well worth speaking with an architect to understand the best options for your interior space.
There are more configurations than you might think, such as:
Straight 
Quarter-turn (L-shaped)
Half-turn (U-shaped)
Winding
Curved
Spiral
Your staircase could also become a design feature in your home. It’s not uncommon to combine these materials for striking effect:
Metal
Hardwood
Softwood
Glass

Find a carpenter your neighbours recommend  Repositioning a staircase Many homes have a staircase that runs from front to back. This can mean that the rooms at the front of the property can be narrower than you’d like, or that they take on an awkward layout. Repositioning the staircase can help to increase the size of the front rooms and create a more spacious feel.
In a narrower property, repositioning a staircase can make a big difference. It can often impact the layout of the upstairs rooms and the positioning of corridor access. This, in turn, will add value to your home.
 When planning to reposition the stairs, it may provide the opportunity to add winders or quarter-turns, depending on the space available. This creates an attractive feature within your home. Reversing the staircase direction Narrower homes can sometimes have an undesirably steep staircase. By reversing the staircase direction, you’ll not only open up a new floor plan downstairs, but you can also reduce how steep your stairs are.
Tip: Add a plinth that’s already a few steps up to make your new stairs less steep. Is changing a staircase expensive? Changing the direction of the staircase undoubtedly involves making alterations to the floor the staircase leads to. Therefore, you’ll need the skills of a professional carpenter and builder to change the arrangement of the floor.
A  carpenter  (or joiner) will cost around 
£25 per hour
. A  builder  will charge somewhere in the region of 
£25 – £35 per hour
.
Changing the staircase direction involves working at height, so budget for the cost of a safety platform too. A 1.8m folding working platform costs around 
£39 per week
 to hire.
The cost to move stairs comes in at around 
£3,100
. Typically, this includes removing the old stairs, buying the new stairs (softwood), plus labour. Read our guide on the  cost of moving your stairs  for an outline of the costs involved.
Other costs that will affect the budget for this project:
Materials – softwood is cheaper than hardwood. Glass looks great, but is expensive. Our  new staircase cost guide  includes pricing on each type
Structural works and alterations
Skimming, decorating, skirting, or making good

Find a carpenter your neighbours recommend  FAQs Are there any regulations for moving a staircase?
There are strict building regulations for staircases, and you should speak to a professional to ensure these are adhered to. In general, they cover areas such as dimensions, headroom, number of stairs before a landing is required, and the angle of the stairs.
In the vast majority of cases, you do not need planning permission to move a staircase if your design does not impact the external appearance of your property.
How much does it cost to change the staircase direction?
Changing the direction of a staircase costs on average 
£3,100
. This includes removing the old staircase and installing a new (softwood) staircase. You may also need to factor in the cost of flooring, plastering, and decorating, depending on the scope of your particular project.

In This Blog: Types of green power solutions Tips for building a green home Green home ideas Ready to make positive changes? Which tradespeople should I use for the job? With climate change becoming more urgent than ever, it’s important for homeowners to do their part with green home energy solutions.
Green home energy solutions are any changes you make to your property that help to reduce its carbon emissions and make it more sustainable. This includes small changes such as switching to LED lighting, installing new insulation or even installing solar panels, all of which are great ways to help protect the environment and reduce your energy bills. Types of green power solutions The energy efficiency of your home can be greatly improved by introducing a range of green power solutions. Whether you make small or large alterations, they all make a difference to the environment.
Some changes to consider include: Installing solar panels  to power your home (you can even sell excess energy back to the grid in warmer months)
Changing your lightbulbs to efficient CFL or LED options
Replacing your current taps and showerheads with low flow models
Choosing energy-efficient appliances when replacing older machines

Find a trusted solar panel installer  Tips for building a green home One of the best ways of making sure your property is as green as possible is to  build it from scratch . Whilst this is not something many people have the means to do, if you’re in a position to do so, you can massively reduce your carbon emissions. Plus, you can design the layout and interior of your home to fit your exact specifications.
Below are some tips for building a green home:
Install  insulation  to reduce energy loss through the walls and roof of your home
Either install solar panels or look into installing a renewable heating system, such as a biomass boiler or a  heat pump Use energy-efficient lighting
Work with an architect or designer who is familiar with building green homes
Consider a  rainwater harvesting system  to recycle water for use in your home
Use recycled or reclaimed materials to build your home
Build using natural, sustainable materials
Install double or  triple glazed windows  to help prevent energy from being wasted
Choose  underfloor heating  to more efficiently warm your home
Install  smart, efficient thermostats  to reduce wasted energy Green home ideas  You don’t need to rush out and completely transform your home overnight to make an impact, you can try some of the below ideas to make a difference:
Look for old pieces of furniture to upcycle rather than buying brand new items
Plant flowers to attract more bees Install larger windows  or add new ones in darker parts of your home to reduce your use of lighting during the day
Add air purifying plants to your home to improve air quality
For more green home ideas, check out our  green home ideas guide  and  sustainable living guide.  Here we’ve got some ways of making your home more sustainable and information about government grants. Ready to make positive changes? If you’re looking to start upgrading to a more sustainable way of living, then you can take some of the suggestions in this guide. While you can definitely make some of the suggested changes yourself, you’ll need professional help for the more complex additions. When it comes to window fitting, insulation installation and adding energy systems, we’d recommend contacting a tradesperson.

Landlord responsibilities: boiler and gas safety,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/landlord-responsibilities-boiler-gas-safety/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Landlord responsibilities: boiler and gas safety

In This Blog: What are landlord responsibilities for boilers? What are landlord gas responsibilities? Book your landlord boiler service and gas safety check FAQs A landlord’s responsibility for boiler and gas safety should be one of the top priorities.
It’s a legal requirement that a qualified Gas Safe registered engineer should inspect the gas supply and appliances at a rented property at least every 12 months.
By law, a landlord must:
Repair and maintain gas pipework, flues, and appliances in a safe condition
Make an annual gas safety check on each appliance and flue
Keep a record of each safety check What are landlord responsibilities for boilers? The Landlord and Tenant Act (1985) states that landlords must keep in good repair and working order installations that supply water, gas and electricity, as well as sanitation systems. Landlords are also responsible for space heating and water heating systems.
Therefore, 
landlords are legally responsible for making sure the boiler is serviced and safe for continued use.
Why get your boiler serviced 
An annual boiler service will:
Help to protect tenants from potentially lethal gases, such as carbon monoxide
Help to ensure the efficiency of the boiler. This will save tenants money on heating bills and is better for the environment
Reduce the likelihood of emergency call outs. This means there won’t be a hit with large, unexpected bills, and tenants won’t be without heating or hot water
Tip: Make sure items are not stored around the boiler as many boilers need ventilation to run safely.
Who can carry out a boiler service?
A gas boiler service must be done every 12 months and be carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer. A Gas Safe engineer will check the boiler and its controls. They will also check for leaks to make sure the pressure is correct, and test the flue for any toxic fumes.
How much does a gas boiler service cost?
When it comes to the  cost of servicing a boiler , there are two options:
Book a boiler service as a one-off fee. This will cost around 
£80
 for a gas boiler*
Take out boiler and central heating cover. Typically, this sits in the region of 
£180 – £300 per year
, and includes any boiler breakdowns, offering you additional peace of mind
*If you have an oil, electric combi boiler, or commercial boiler, please read our post on  boiler service cost  for more information.

Find a Gas Safe engineer your neighbours recommend  What are landlord gas responsibilities? Landlord responsibilities for gas safety checks are covered under the  Gas Safety (Installation & Use) Regulations 1998 . This piece of legislation states that it’s a mandatory requirement for landlords to ensure the safety of their tenants. Landlords are legally obliged to have any gas appliances serviced with the frequency required by the manufacturer.
Any gas appliance owned by the landlord and provided for the tenant’s use is included with the landlord’s legal duties
If a tenant has their own gas appliances, not provided by the landlord, the landlord is only responsible for parts of the associated installation and pipework, but not for the appliance itself
Who can carry out a gas safety check? 
A gas safety check must be carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer. A landlord is legally required to make sure this is the case.
Tip: Make sure tenants know where and how to turn the gas supply off in the event of an emergency.
What is covered by a gas safety check?
A Gas Safe engineer will check all gas appliances within the property. This includes the boiler, cooker, and fire. All fittings, chimneys and flues will also be checked as part of this inspection.
While it’s not included within the gas safety check, it’s recommended you ask your Gas Safe engineer to also test and examine the pipework by asking for a visual examination of the pipework and for the engineer to test the tightness of the gas system, including installation pipework.
Upon completion of a gas safety check, providing all appliances are safe, you’ll be issued with a CP12 Certificate. You must give a copy of this certificate to your tenant within 28 days of issue. You must also keep copies of the gas safety checks for at least two years.
How much does a gas safety check cost?
The  cost of a gas safety certificate  is around 
£80
 and should be carried out every 10 – 12 months. Book your landlord boiler service and gas safety check To ensure compliance with the law, and to help identify any minor issues before they become major, more costly problems, book a Gas Safe engineer to visit your tenanted property.
A Gas Safe engineer is the only person legally allowed to complete this job, so use our  request a quote  feature to get multiple quotes from Checkatrade members in your area now.
What’s more, when you book a  guaranteed  tradesperson with Checkatrade, you’ll not only have peace of mind that your Gas Safe engineer comes highly recommended but also that their work is covered for 12 months.

Find a Gas Safe engineer your neighbours recommend  FAQs How long does a landlord have to fix a broken boiler?
Section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act (1985) outlines that repairs should be carried out in a ‘reasonable time’. Having no heating or hot water constitutes a hazard under the law, therefore emergency repairs should be fixed within 24-hours.
Does my landlord have to service my old boiler?
Yes. By law, a landlord is legally required to have the boiler in their tenanted property serviced every year by a Gas Safe engineer.
When should a landlord replace a boiler?
As a general rule of thumb, if the boiler is more than 15 years old, it’s often worth considering replacing it, before it starts costing you in repairs.
Some warning signs that the boiler might need replacing include: banging, whistling or gurgling noises, leaking, increased frequency of repairs, taking longer to heat up, and rooms not heating evenly throughout the property.

How to fit a tap in 6 steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/fit-tap/,"Bathroom, Garden, Kitchen","How to fit a tap in 6 steps

In This Blog: How to fit an outside tap How to fit a kitchen tap How to fit a kitchen tap with flexible hoses How to fit a mixer tap in 6 quick steps How to fit bath taps Fitting a monobloc tap Fitting a kitchen tap with a pull-out hose FAQs So, you want to know how to change a tap? Whether you’re looking to refresh your kitchen with a new style of tap or if your bathroom tap’s on the brink, then you may want to get it changed sooner rather than later.
For an experienced DIYer, replacing a tap is a relatively straightforward job. All it takes is a little planning and the correct tools. But for someone who doesn’t have hands-on experience, it can be quite an intimidating job to complete.
We’ve put together this guide with step-by-step instructions to show you how to fit a tap. We’ll also be covering tips on fitting mixer taps, monobloc taps, and answering your frequently asked questions. This guide will either guide you in changing your taps or encourage you to reach out to a professional plumber to do the job for you.
If you’re ever in doubt about your DIY abilities, then always play it safe by  hiring a professional plumber  to do the job for you. How to fit an outside tap Tools you’ll need:
A screwdriver
An adjustable spanner
An SDS drill
An 18mm SDS drill bit
A 7mm SDS drill bit
A 15mm pipe cutter
Water pump pliers
15mm pipe collar – (optional)
Step 1: Drill an 18mm hole directly through the wall
Consider where your outdoor tap will be installed, then figure out where your mains water supply is located so you can connect your tap pipework to it. We recommend having them nearby one another.
Measure the area in which your drill bit will enter the wall from the outside. When you’re drilling through the wall from the outside, make sure there’s no chance you’ll come into contact with anything on the wall’s interior.
Finally, mark where you want the outside tap to go, then start drilling.
Top tip: 
It’s important to drill the wall from the outside to prevent blowing the brick out on the outside.
When you have around an inch or so to go, switch off the hammer mode on your SDS drill and use the drill function instead.
Step 2: Affix the backplate and outdoor tap
Ensure the copper pipe inside the property is placed correctly, then drive the backplate through the wall.
If needed, cut back the copper pipework.
Once the brass backplate is flush with the wall, use a pencil and mark the three holes on the surface of the wall.
Take away the backplate and carefully use your drill to make 7mm screw holes.
Step 3: 
Attach the water supply to the copper pipe
The best way to connect this to the water supply is by adding an elbow to the copper.
Next, insert a length of pipe to the elbow you’re using (place it inside the 15mm tee fitting). This should be attached to your property’s cold water mains supply.

Find plumbers your neighbours recommend  How to fit a kitchen tap Tools you’ll need to fit a tap:
Screwdriver
Sink spanner
An adjustable wrench
Your new taps
Tap connector pipe(s)
Junior hacksaw
Pipe cutting tool
Step 1: Remove your old taps
As obvious as it sounds, before you embark on  fitting a kitchen tap , you’ll need to switch off your water supply. If you fail to do this, there’ll no doubt be a lot of water carnage in your house!
Next, turn on the taps so that they run the system dry.
Use a wrench to unfasten the nut that affixes the supply pipes to the tap. This bit can be tricky, but all you need is a little patience.
Lastly, unfasten the nut that connects your basin or bath to your taps.
Top tip:
 It’s a good idea to get someone else to hold onto the tap to stop it from turning while you unfasten the nut.
Step 2: Clean the area
Once you’ve removed your old taps, be sure to clean the area and get rid of any remaining dirt and adhesive.
Inspect the condition of your joins, pipes, and fixings. If anything needs repairing, now’s the time to do so.
Make sure that your new taps’ fittings work correctly with your old pipes. If not, then you may need an adaptor. If you’re using plastic fittings, then you may need a plumber for the pipework. And you’ll need a reducing coupler for taps with one spout (monobloc taps).
Typically, your new tap will include a 10mm pipe, which will need to increase to the 15mm supply pipe.
Your plumbing will probably already be in place if you’re carrying out this job from scratch. Be sure the tap is placed correctly so that it extends to the sink or bath.
Step 3: Positioning your new taps
Position your taps inside the sink or bath’s holes. The washers should sit in between the sink or bath’s surface and the tap. Then, affix the tap using a back nut.
Step 4: Connect the supply pipes
After you’ve attached the taps, you can then connect the supply pipes. You can either use plush-fit plastic fittings or copper piping for this.
If your taps are in an awkward position, copper piping is more suitable, although you’ll probably need a solder and blowtorch to fix the lengths together.
Step 5: Connect the water supply
Hand tighten each end until you achieve the best position so that the water runs easily. Be sure to keep your plumbing tidy so that there aren’t any turns or twists.
Finally, tighten each end.
Step 6: Detecting leaks
Turn on the water gently, so the taps run. Even the tiniest drop of water can cause long-term damage. So, inspect around the taps and around the connections to make sure that no water is leaking.
If you spot any water escaping, tighten the connections and nuts and try again. If water is still leaking, it might be time to call your  local plumber  – they may have to take it apart and start again. How to fit a kitchen tap with flexible hoses A flexible hose, otherwise known as a flexible tap connector, connects taps to the water supply. It’s useful for connecting taps in cramped areas.
Fitting a tap with flexible hoses is a fairly simple job, but one that requires specialist equipment and expertise. Here’s a quick overview of the typical kitchen tap installation process:
Preparation
Connecting the kitchen tap with flexible hoses
Fitting the tap
Connecting and testing How to fit a mixer tap in 6 quick steps Unsure of how to install a shower mixer tap? These tap types combine cold and hot water within the tap’s body. They do this using a single lever that rotates from left to right. Or they use individual cold and hot controls to ascertain the stream of cold and hot water.
Here’s a quick overview of how to fit a mixer tap:
Take away the old tap and remove the connection, then detach the nut (it’s hexagonal) that keeps the tap secure.
Remove your old taps and clean the area. Secure the tap tails so that they sit tightly in the tap’s frame.
Attach the fixing studs to the tap’s base. Place the tap above the countertop or sink’s tap hole. Next, pull the fixing studs and tap tails across them.
Affix a retaining plate and washer over the fixing studs from underneath the tap hole. Place nuts on the fixing studs.
Once the tap’s in the right position, use a spanner to screw in the nuts tightly. Be careful not to harm the sink, though.
Switch on the mains water supply to ensure no water can escape. If any water escapes, inspect the connectors, then adjust if necessary. How to fit bath taps Fitting a bathroom tap is fairly similar to fitting a kitchen tap. So, refer to the ‘how to fit a kitchen tap’ guidelines above for detailed instructions.
Before you start this task, take away the bath panel to remove and install the new bath taps.
Acrylic bath panels just slip into place. If not, find push on/off magnetic catches or screws that fasten the panel. It’s possible you might need to take off a section of the supporting structure to allow you to get underneath the bath.
First and foremost, you’ll need to know which bath tap you have. Usually, bath taps come in two types:
Pillar taps
 – two individual taps for cold and hot water.
Mixer taps
 – one individual tap that blends both cold and hot water. Typically, these include a shower fixture, too, often known as a bath shower mixer tap.
Other less-known bath tap choices include wall-mounted taps, valve-operated bath fillers, and freestanding taps. If you don’t know which tap type you have, it’s best to speak to a professional plumber.
Tools you’ll need:
New taps
A wrench
A back nut
A blowtorch and a solder (if you’re using copper piping to relink the water supply pipes)
Here’s a quick overview of the steps involved. Please note, the below steps relate to separate hot and cold taps (bath pillar taps), not mixer taps:
Prepare the area.
Turn off your water supply.
Unfasten the tap connectors.
Detach the bath tap.
Clean the area.
Check the condition of your fixings, pipes, and joins.
Put the new bath tap in place.
Install the connectors to your replacement bath tap.
Attach the connectors to your pipes (either using push-fit plastic fittings or copper piping).
Position the back nut.
Hand tighten the nut.
Repeat the previous step.
Install the flexible tap tails.
Switch on the water at the mains.
Make sure there aren’t any leaks.

Preparing your garden for the winter,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/winter-garden-preparation/,Garden,"Preparing your garden for the winter

In This Blog: Cut back certain flowers to the ground Protect seasonal plants by bringing them indoors Remove fallen leaves from the grass Tidy borders and add new soil Plant bulbs for next year Don’t forget your house plants FAQs The winter can play havoc on your garden if you’re not prepared. Don’t waste all the hard work you put into your garden during the spring and summer, make sure your garden is prepared for the seasonal change.
We spoke to the team at  Denham Gardeners  for their top tips on how to prep the garden for the winter, so that you can have a healthy garden all year round. Cut back certain flowers to the ground A lot of flowers will naturally come to the end of their bloom as the cold hits and it’s important to cut them back. Perennials, such as roses, will need to have their longer stems trimmed to stop them from snapping in any storms. Autumn-fruiting raspberries on the other hand will need to be cut down to within 5cm of the ground. It’s also a good time to cut back clematis, wisteria and any fruit bushes.
If you’re unsure on which plants need cutting back, then we recommend  hiring a professional gardener  as they will be able to advise you and make sure your plants are cut back to where they need to be. Protect seasonal plants by bringing them indoors Some plants are too fragile to withstand the winter chills, but that doesn’t mean they can’t make it through another year. It’s simply a case of potting them up and bringing them indoors into the warm.
This includes plants such as dahlias and gladiolus. As long as they are indoors away from the frost, they will be okay.
Speak to one of our gardening experts if you’re not sure which plants to bring in. Remove fallen leaves from the grass Fallen leaves from trees and bushes will need to be removed from the grass before a lot of rain or even snow, falls. If not, the leaves can end up suffocating the grass, causing damp patches and potentially mould and rotting.
This can be done using either a rake or leaf blower, with the leaves added to a compost pile to help create next year’s soil. Tidy borders and add new soil When the flowers aren’t big and in bloom, you have better access to work on your borders. It’s the perfect time to remove any weeds, dig up any old soil and add fresh layers of soil ready for the spring.
Not only will it be good for the health of your borders, but it will also make them tidy so that everything is easier to manage over the winter months because let’s face it, you want to be out in the cold as little as possible!
You don’t have to get your hands dirty though, you can either wear some gardening gloves or even easier, hire a gardener to come and do the work – then you’ll be safe in the knowledge that everything is being done properly. Plant bulbs for next year Winter may be nearing the end of the year, but it’s also a great opportunity for the start of something new. Now is a great time to plant bulbs for the springtime. Tulips, daffodils, pansies, bluebells and snowdrops are some of the most popular to plant for the spring. Don’t forget your house plants House plants will also need a little TLC in the colder months. Darker days mean less sunlight and warmth for your plants and so they will go into a dormant stage. Because of this, it’s important not to give them the same amount of water as you would in the summer. Other things you can do include:
Cleaning their leaves to remove any dust or dirt
Keeping them warm and away from any draughts
Putting them into light, preferably a conservatory if you have one

Find gardeners your neighbours recommend  FAQs When should I prepare my garden for winter?
The best time to make a start on preparing your garden for winter is November. You will want to start by getting your garden in order by clearing debris and making it as tidy as possible. Be careful not to over dig your soil though, it needs protection from the winter weather.
How do I get my garden ready for winter?
To get your garden ready for winter, follow the below checklist: Cut back certain flowers to the ground Protect seasonal plants by bringing them indoors Remove fallen leaves from the grass Tidy borders and add new soil Plant bulbs for next year If you’re struggling for time or you don’t feel confident in the garden winter prep, then one of our  gardening members  can help you.
Should I cover my garden in the winter?
Yes, you should cover your garden. Future you and your soil will thank you when you hit spring.
Covering your garden means it will halt those early spring weeds and protect those beneficial insects living inside the garden from frost and snow. You can do this by applying compost, or by applying compost and another cover for protection too. The nutrients in the compost will give a healthy boost through the chilly months ahead.
When should you till your garden?
The best time to till a garden is in the spring. This is when the soil is dry and the weather is taking a positive turn. So you could till as early as March, but some people decide to wait until May or June.

The cost mentioned above usually includes delivery and installation, but we strongly advise speaking to your local builder, as the prices we’ve provided are estimates only.

Find builders your neighbours recommend for the job  The cost to build a bowling alley in your home: A few things to consider As mentioned above, it costs between 
£150,000 – £600,000
 to build a bowling alley in the home.
Depending on how much you have to spend on your bowling alley, you can plump for several elements to include in yours. Think about your own bowling alley experience, then consider which designs, factors, and extras might be useful to include.
Here are a few to bear in mind:
Lanes
Usually, a bowling alley is about 18 metres, so whatever room you decide to build your bowling alley in will need a minimum of this much space in length. We recommend you plan for a room of about 25 metres in length, so there’s enough room for a seating area at the top of the lane.
Bowling balls
If you’re working with a builder than they will not be providing the bowling balls. It’s easy to buy balls on the internet or keep an eye out for second-hand ones instead.
Ball return
Another cost to consider in the design process is the ball return technologies of your bowling alley. If you don’t have to wait for the ball to roll back to you, it’s not an authentic bowling alley experience, right?
Pins
Plain, white pins are a classic look for any bowling alley. You can get tons of other designs and personalisation options if you want the 
wow
 factor.
Consider having a crest or your family initials printed on your pins. Alternatively, your pins could feature a personal photograph (perhaps that laugh-out-loud pic of your child making a face after trying an orange a few years ago).
Monitors and scoring
If you have a tighter budget, you can simply keep a record of scoring using pen and paper scorecards rather than installing tablets and monitors above the lanes.
Another factor to think about is the number of lanes you want in your home bowling alley. The more lanes you want, the more it’ll cost to build. The average cost to build a bowling alley As mentioned, the average cost to build a bowling alley in your home is about 
£550,000.
Looking for a bowling alley installer you can trust? Try our  free search feature . Just enter your postcode to find a whole host of local, experienced tradespeople, recommended by your neighbours. You can check out their work history on their profile and see reviews from other customers.
If you book one of our trustworthy experts, you’re able to inspect their profile and read all their customer reviews. Better yet, those reviews are from your neighbours and verified by us to ensure they’re authentic.
And another thing. For your peace of mind, if you hire one of our members for the job, we  guarantee their work  so that you and your house are in safe hands.

Find builders your neighbours recommend for the job  FAQs How much does it cost to build a bowling lane?
It’ll set you back about 
£20,000
 to build one bowling lane in your home. However, this doesn’t include a scoring system, which would probably set you back a further 
£5,000
.
How much would it cost to build a 24-lane bowling alley?
Assuming the average cost to build one bowling lane is about 
£20,000
, to build a 24-lane bowling alley, you’re looking at roughly 
£480,000.

Find a builder to build your photography studio  FAQs Is a photo studio profitable?
Most definitely, especially if you’re passionate about what you do.
You could also consider other ways to make money such as introducing photography courses, taking on outdoor photoshoots such as weddings and also videography. Of course, part of your success will be down to how well you market yourself and word of mouth recommendations too.
How much space do you need for a photography studio?
It’s perfectly possible to have a photography studio that’s about the size of a bedroom or smaller, but a compact set-up may feel a little cramped, particularly if you want more space for your subjects to move around for action shots.
It’s important to consider the ceiling height to make sure it’s adequate for installing a hair light and ceiling light. Typically, a regular three to three-and-a-half-metre ceiling is more than enough for a full-length body portrait photography project. you’ll also need to make sure there’s enough action space for your subjects and equipment such as stands, flashes and reflectors.

How to remove cladding from a house,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/remove-cladding/,Garden,"How to remove cladding from a house

In This Blog: How to remove timber cladding How to remove plastic cladding How to remove fake brick cladding How to remove stone cladding Professional cladding removal Which tradesperson should I hire to remove my cladding? FAQs Cladding was very popular in the 1970s with a lot of homeowners choosing to insulate and decorate their properties with a variety of cladding (mainly stone). Many types of cladding are now no longer seen as desirable and, in some cases, don’t meet fire regulations. So, if your home is covered in unwanted cladding, you may be looking at how to remove cladding from a house.
Read on to find out the best ways to remove different types of cladding.
First things first, gather the following tools:
Extension ladder
Gloves
Goggles
Pry bar
Pliers
Reciprocating saw with a metal blade How to remove timber cladding Once you have all the tools listed above to hand, use the below steps:
Set your ladder against the wall you’ll be working on. Start at the top of the wall and ensure your ladder reaches high enough to allow you to safely reach the uppermost piece of cladding
Clear an area underneath your ladder where you’ll drop the cladding as you work. You could use a wheelbarrow or large container to keep things neat
Put on your gloves and safety goggles for protection
Use the pry bar to loosen the first piece of cladding by pushing it under the timber and wiggling it
Once the cladding has loosened a little, use your reciprocating saw to cut through the nails
Pull the loose cladding away from your wall and drop it into the area you cleared
Use the pliers to remove the remaining nails from the wall
Repeat steps 3 – 6 for each subsequent cladding board until your wall is clear
Remove any remaining insulation and dispose of this safely

Find a cladding removal specialist  How to remove plastic cladding Plastic cladding is fitted differently to timber cladding, and this means you’ll need to use a different method to remove it. You’ll need a hammer and chisel to remove the cladding. Use the below steps:
If you’re removing internal plastic cladding, make sure to use a drop cloth to protect your flooring from falling pieces of it
Position your chisel under the first cladding panel. Next, use a hammer to tap the top of the chisel letting it move further under the cladding
You can then start to wiggle the chisel, loosening the panel
This means you can fit your pry bar under the cladding and pull it away from the wall
Continue following these steps until you have removed all the cladding from your wall How to remove fake brick cladding Fake brick cladding is often used to give the effect of a real brick wall for a fraction of the price, with easier installation. If this type of cladding isn’t to your taste, you can learn how to remove fake brick cladding yourself.
Depending on how this cladding was attached to your wall, this job can be quite tricky so use the following steps:
Clear the space around your wall and where you’ll be working to avoid damaging your possessions. You can also protect your flooring or worktops by laying down towels or a drop cloth
Check whether the fake brick cladding was attached using nails or glue, as this will affect how you remove it
If nails were used originally then use a claw hammer to loosen the corner of the cladding from the wall
This should help to pull the nails out of the wall, allowing you to remove the fake brick cladding. Continue for the rest of the wall
If glue was used to attach the cladding this is a little harder to remove. You’ll need to use a paint scraper to scrape the fake brick cladding off of your wall
If you’re struggling with this method, you can also try using a chisel and hammer to loosen the cladding section by section
Once your wall is cladding free, you’ll need to remove the remaining glue which can be done with your paint scraper How to remove stone cladding Removing exterior stone cladding isn’t an easy job. Most of the stones are fixed in place using cement and the only way to remove them is with force. This means using a hammer, chisel, or pry bar to chip away at the mortar between the stone cladding, then chiselling each stone away from the wall. Due to the difficulty level, we’d recommend leaving stone cladding removal to a  professional .

Find a cladding removal specialist  Professional cladding removal Cladding removal is often quite tricky and unless it is done properly your walls may be damaged beyond repair. Plus, removing cladding can be very time consuming and arduous, meaning this isn’t a project suited to everyone.
If you have a busy life or struggle physically, the best option is to contact a professional to do the work for you. This will save you a lot of time and energy.
We can assist with your search for an experienced professional. Just use our  handy search  to find trusted tradespeople near you. You can take a look at pictures and reviews of their previous work and be safe in the knowledge that we have checked them.
Looking for further support? Take a look at the  HomeOwners Alliance  website. You can read helpful articles around different DIY projects from bathroom refurbishment to planning permission. They can also help with online property valuation and getting insurance. Which tradesperson should I hire to remove my cladding? It’s vital that you hire the right person to remove your cladding to prevent damage to your walls and home. The best professional to remove cladding is a general builder. Remember, you can easily search our website to find your  local builder . FAQs Can you remove cladding from a house?
Absolutely. You can remove cladding from a house using the step-by-step instructions in this guide. The main instance when we’d suggest you hire a professional is if you’re removing stone cladding and if you want to minimise the risk of damage to your home or yourself.
Can you clad over cladding?
While it may be possible, we’d definitely not advise trying to clad over cladding. This can cause many issues in the future and should be avoided if possible.
Is it easy to remove cladding?
This really depends on the type of cladding and how it was attached. Removing timber cladding can be relatively simple but will still require a little elbow grease. Stone cladding or fake brick cladding attached with adhesive however is definitely not easy to remove.
How should I install new cladding?
Once you’ve removed your old cladding, you may wish to install new cladding to protect and enhance your walls. Luckily, we have a guide dedicated to installing timber cladding which is the perfect resource if this is your goal. Check out our guide on  how to install cladding  today.

In This Blog: How to install external timber cladding How to finish corners on timber cladding Vertical timber cladding fixing details How to install internal cladding How can I ensure my cladding looks flawless? How much does professional cladding installation cost? FAQs Timber cladding is a great option to decorate your home with, both internally and externally. Not only does it look good but it’s also sustainable.
We’ve created this guide with step-by-step instructions to show you how to install cladding. We’ll also be covering finishing corners on timber cladding, adding details, and answering your FAQs.
Tools and materials
Before you start, you’ll need to gather all the tools and materials that you will need, including:
Cladding
Battens
Cladding pins
Paint or stain for your cladding
Spirit level
Sandpaper
Saw
Hammer
Nails
Pencil for marking How to install external timber cladding When you install cladding on the outside of your home, you need to also use a house wrap and foam insulation. This will help to keep your home warm and prevent energy loss.
Follow the below steps to install your external cladding.
Start by measuring your walls and ensuring you have enough cladding to cover your entire home
You can then cover your home in house wrap, fixing it in place with a staple gun. Then use nails to fix foam insulation in place
Attach battens to your walls using nails
Once your battens are installed, start attaching your first row of cladding boards, moving from the bottom of your wall to the top
Keep moving up your wall, attaching each cladding board before moving to the next
Finally, install any corner pieces and trims
Top tip: 
Ensure you use a spirit level to make sure your cladding is straight. How to finish corners on timber cladding To finish corners on timber cladding we’d recommend using a corner block of timber. When attaching your cladding be sure to leave a 90-degree angle at the end of each wall. You can then use nails to attach a block of timber that is the height of your wall to fill the gap. Vertical timber cladding fixing details The difference between using horizontal and vertical timber cladding fixing details is minor. All you need to know is that if you plan to install 
vertical cladding,
 you’ll need to first install 
horizontal battens
.
Alternatively, if you plan to install 
horizontal cladding
, you’ll need to first install 
vertical battens.

Find a cladding specialist near you  How to install internal cladding Once you have everything you need to hand, use the following steps to install your internal timber cladding:
Prepare your cladding by laying it out close to where it will be installed. Leave it for two weeks to allow it to acclimatise
Ensure your wall is clean and free from wallpaper. Also, remove any skirting boards or shelves. Then, check that the wall is stable enough to support the extra weight of the cladding 
(Please note: if your  plaster  is crumbling or damaged, this should be dealt with before you install your cladding)
Start by fitting the battens to your wall with the first batten positioned just over the skirting board. Use nails to fix these in place horizontally with gaps of 40cm between each batten
Check that your cladding is clean and dust-free, then decide whether to treat it before installing. It’ll be easier to do this before installation as you’ll have better access to each board
Measure the height of your wall and then trim the cladding to size with a saw. Next, use sandpaper to remove any jagged edges
Start attaching your cladding to the wall using cladding pins and a hammer. Check each piece of cladding is flat using your spirit level before hammering nails through into the battens on your walls
Slot each piece of cladding into the previous piece, frequently checking its level, then nail in place
Finish by reinstalling your skirting board and any shelves or pictures
Top tip: 
Don’t apply any paint to the indents where your cladding boards fit together or this will cause issues later. How can I ensure my cladding looks flawless? If you’re a beginner to DIY and have no experience installing cladding, it may be harder to get the results you’re hoping for. The best way to combat any worries or mistakes is to contact a qualified tradesperson to take on your project. While you’ll need to pay for installation, you can guarantee the job will be done to a high standard in a fraction of the time it would have taken you.
Looking for an expert you can trust? Try our  free search feature . Simply enter your postcode to find a range of local, experienced tradespeople who are recommended by your neighbours. You can check out their previous work on their profile and have a look at reviews from other customers. How much does professional cladding installation cost? If you’d prefer to hire an expert to install your cladding, you may be curious as to how much this will cost. Our  house cladding cost guide  covers the different costs you can expect to pay. As a guide, it’ll cost around 
£300 – £600
 to install cladding on a single wall on an average gable roof house (not including the price of the cladding itself).
Thermowood cladding is another cladding option to consider. It is treated with pressure and heat to make it more weather resistant and costs on average 
£42.50 per m2
 to install
.
 Check out our  thermowood cladding cost guide  for the latest prices and advice.

Find a cladding specialist near you  FAQs How do you attach wooden cladding to a wall?
As we mentioned earlier in this article, using nails is the best and most secure way to attach cladding to a wall. However, you can also use wood adhesive, although this will not be as durable and shouldn’t be used externally.
How far apart should battens be for cladding?
For the best results, you should leave 40cm between battens.
Can you install cladding yourself?
Yes, you can install cladding yourself. Having said this, cladding installation may be too complex for DIY beginners, although we hope this guide will help to simplify the process. If you’re concerned about whether installing cladding yourself is a good idea, consider hiring a professional to alleviate your worries.
Which tradesperson should I use to install cladding?
It’s important to hire the right tradesperson for your project to ensure you get the best results possible. Depending on the type of cladding you choose, you’ll need to hire either a carpenter or a general builder to install your cladding.

In This Blog: How to block out firework noise in your home How to reduce the impact of garden fireworks Quick home hacks to calm your scared animal this fireworks night Top tips to help calm your scared animals on bonfire night FAQs As a nation of pet lovers, we’ll do anything to stop our pets from being stressed, and fireworks can be a real cause for concern for pet owners.
Bonfire Night is a time where we worry about loud noises and flashing lights that will scare our animals. Pets cowering, pacing, whining, or having accidents around the home are all telltale signs that they’re overcome with fear. And it’s heartbreaking to watch.
There are steps you can take to help your pets through the fireworks season. To help reduce their unnecessary fear and distress, read on to learn:
Some effective ‘quick fixes’ to help calm your pet.
Longer-term fixes to help soundproof your home.
How to reduce the impact of garden fireworks.
Our top tips for calming your pet during fireworks night. How to block out firework noise in your home Our experts have produced detailed information on soundproofing the various parts of your home (and garden) to help filter out any unwanted surrounding noise. We’ll link to these posts so you can review the costs involved in each project.
Here’s a helpful overview:
Soundproof a room or your home
A professional soundproofing specialist will help to determine what type of noise you’re dealing with, and the best course of action to remedy it. This will ensure you don’t waste money on the wrong solution.
If you can hear your neighbours’ conversations, music or TV, the noise is airborne. However, if you’re disturbed by your neighbours’ footsteps or dining chairs skirting along the floor, the noise is caused by impact vibration.
The good news is, there are various solutions to help combat these frustrating noises and enjoy a more peaceful home. Take a look at this post on  soundproofing your home  to find out more about soundproofing everything from floors to walls, ceilings and doors.

Find soundproofers your neighbours recommend 
Soundproof your windows
Soundproofing your windows will not only banish firework noise, but it’ll significantly reduce air pollution from busy nearby roads.
While it’s not a cheap fix, soundproofing your windows will increase the value of your home and boost the appeal of your home should you ever put it on the market.
The cheapest and simplest way to soundproof your windows is to install secondary glazing. This costs around 
£400 per window
.
Next on the cost scale is installing new, soundproof casement windows. This will set you back between 
£895 – £1,860 per window
 – depending on the size of the windows.
If you have traditional sash windows, expect to pay between 
£1,365 – £4,760 per window
 to replace them with soundproof sash windows.
For more information, read our  soundproof windows cost guide .
A professional window fitter will be able to measure up and give you a quote. Be sure to ask about the sound transmission class (STC) rating to make sure you get the soundproofing you desire.
Soundproof fencing
Your garden should be a place to relax and unwind, so if busy roads or noisy neighbours are ruining your tranquillity, consider installing soundproof fencing.
The  cost of soundproof fencing  varies depending on the type of fence panel you choose. Wood, concrete and metal are three of the most popular options. As a general rule, the thicker and denser your fence panel, the higher the cost.
The average cost for a soundproof fence is around 
£140 – £200 per 6’ x 6’ panel
.
A professional soundproof fence specialist will be able to assess your needs and provide a quote for the job. Use our  request a quote  feature to receive quotes from local soundproof fence specialists that your neighbours would recommend. How to reduce the impact of garden fireworks Soundproofing your home and garden is an effective long-term solution to banish unwanted noise from fireworks and more. However, there are plenty of ideas that offer soundproofing qualities alongside other benefits.
Have you considered:
Installing  screening in the garden  to reduce noise, increase privacy, and create interesting zones? Planting thick bushes and tall trees  to reduce noise pollution while increasing greenery and biodiversity? Building a dog kennel  to create a safe haven for your pooch – one indoors, of course!
You could even ask your neighbours to use silent fireworks. Quick home hacks to calm your scared animal this fireworks night With fireworks night just around the corner, here are some quick and simple fixes to help create a calm, reassuring environment for your pet.
Invest in soft furnishings
Sound bounces off hard surfaces. An easy way to soften the acoustics in your home is to lay some warm, thick rugs to reduce sound penetration.
Install curtains or blinds
If your home is lacking in window dressings, now’s the perfect time to get that job off the list. Blackout curtains or blinds are great at reducing light, while heavy fabrics such as velvet do an excellent job reducing light and noise.
A local tradesperson will charge an average of 
£75
 to measure and fit a curtain pole, and around 
£87.50
 to fit a blind. Check out our post on the  cost of fitting curtains and blinds  for everything you need to know.
Make a cosy den
Dogs and cats will appreciate a cosy den or hiding place they can retreat to during fireworks. Place blankets over a side table or their pet crate and fill the space underneath with familiar bedding, blankets and teddies. Top tips to help calm your scared animals on bonfire night Dogs firework tips
Be prepared:
Take your dog for its walk before dark.
Feed your pooch before the fireworks begin – if your dog becomes stressed by the loud bangs, it could prevent him/her from eating.
Ensure your house and garden are secure to ensure your dog can’t run away if it’s scared, and close windows and curtains to muffle firework noise.
Make a doggie-safe den.
During the fireworks:
Don’t leave your dog home alone during the fireworks.
Try to distract your dog by playing games indoors or doing some reward-based training.
Turn on the TV or radio to help mask the sound of the fireworks.
Allow your dog to shelter in their safe space – don’t force your dog to come out or venture outside.
Your dog will pick up on how you’re feeling, so stay calm and offer plenty of comfort and reassurance, both in your actions and your tone of voice.
Cats firework tips
Keep your cat indoors during fireworks.
Provide hiding places around your home where your cat can feel more secure. They may choose to settle under furniture, in a cardboard box, or on your lap!
Smaller pet firework tips
For smaller pets who live outdoors, you can cover half of their cage, pen, or aviary with a blanket to create one area that’s well soundproofed. Ensure they can see out of the other half.
Extra bedding is a good idea to provide an opportunity for your smaller pets to burrow.
Firework tips for horses
Try to keep your horse, pony or donkey in a familiar environment with their usual companion.
Check that your horse’s field is secure.
Ensure hay nets in their stable are well tied up to avoid your horse getting tangled.
If you stay with your horse during fireworks, remember a startled horse can be very dangerous.
Car manufacturer, Ford, has demonstrated its pet-loving credentials by producing a prototype soundproof dog house, using sound-cancelling techniques. True story.
While this concept may take a while to hit the mass market, our tradespeople are on hand now to complete any soundproofing jobs you need help with.

Find soundproofers your neighbours recommend  FAQs Why are dogs scared of fireworks?
The noise and unpredictability of fireworks triggers your dog’s fight-or-flight response in their nervous system. This is part of their survival mechanism – a way to keep themselves safe from a perceived threat. In other words, running away from these loud noises is a survival instinct.
How to calm a dog from fireworks?
If your dog is distressed by firework noise, stay with it at home and offer plenty of comfort and reassurance. You can create a doggie den to act as a safe space, play some reward-based games to distract them, and put the TV on to muffle outside noise.
What can I do to help my dog with fireworks?
There are lots of last-minute things you can do to help your dog cope with firework noise. Take a look back through this post to learn about creating a doggie den or installing curtains to block out noise and flashing lights.

How to clean gutters,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/clean-gutters/,Roof,"How to clean gutters

In This Blog: How to clean gutters How to clean gutters from the ground How to clean gutters with a pressure washer How to clean gutters above a conservatory FAQs Clean gutters are key to the overall health of your home. Clogged gutters can cause issues with water seepage, and if left unresolved, can cause problems with the foundations, framing and walls of your home.
Reaching your gutters isn’t always easy, and adverse weather conditions can make it trickier. Staying safe when cleaning out the backlog in your gutters is paramount. That’s why we recommend  hiring a professional  your neighbours know and trust (read our  gutter cleaning cost guide  for more information) to do this job for you.
Still looking to do it yourself? Read on for three different ways to clean your gutters.

Hire the gutter expert your neighbours trust  How to clean gutters The gutter cleaning tools you need
Hosepipe and various attachments
Safety goggles, boots and gloves
Garden trowel
Garden waste bucket
Ladder
Old cloth/rag
White vinegar
Waterproofs How to clean gutters from the ground Knowing how to clean gutters without a ladder is the safest way to remove debris. However, when it comes to larger jobs, standing on the ground isn’t the most efficient way to ensure a deep clean. Also, several of these methods are messy and only partially effective.
With that said, here are five ways you can clean your gutters from the ground without a ladder:
Using a garden hose with a ‘U’ shaped attachment
Purchasing a specialised gutter vacuum
Hiring a power washer
Using your leaf blower
A gutter flusher cleaning product How to clean gutters with a pressure washer This section is going to focus on how to clean gutters and downspouts. Follow these six steps to clean your gutters using a pressure washer:
Take out your pressure washer and fit the appropriate attachment. Test it against your driveway/concrete pavement to make sure the spray is thin and direct enough to avoid it spilling over your gutters. This also lets you work out how to control the washer
Put on your safety equipment and waterproofs and place your ladder (if you’re using one) directly under the gutters. Make sure it’s as secure as possible (maybe ask a friend or family member to help)
Test your hose to make sure it reaches the gutters you want to flush. If not, you’ll need to use an extension wand
Before you begin, scoop out any large amount of debris by hand or with a trowel. This stops bulky debris from being blown across your property or blocking your downspouts
Now you’ve prepped, it’s time to turn on the pressure washer and get to work. Start from the downspout on the inside of the gutter and slowly follow the gutter’s trajectory until it’s all clean. This helps to prevent your downspouts from being clogged
Finally, make sure you clean up any mess! How to clean gutters above a conservatory The best way to remove debris from your conservatory gutters is with a handheld garden trowel. As conservatories are usually flat-roofed and situated near trees, debris build-up can happen quickly. That’s why we recommend cleaning out your downpipes and gutters at least twice a year. Once you’ve removed the impacted matter, wipe your pipes down with a damp cloth to keep the surfaces smooth. This removes lumps and bumps that trap dirt and hasten the build-up of debris.
If you’re looking to get the rest of your conservatory cleaned, it’s worth taking a look at our  uPVC cleaning prices .
Note:
 For this method, you’ll need to use a ladder to reach your gutters.

Hire the gutter expert your neighbours trust  FAQs What is the easiest way to clean gutters?
The easiest and less intensive way to clean gutters is by hand. All you need is a bucket, scoop, work gloves, and a ladder. However, there are safety concerns to be aware of, such as securing your ladder and making sure the area is risk assessed before you can begin.
What is the best thing to clean gutters with?
To make sure you deep clean your gutters, try an at-home solution such as white vinegar and water mixtures, which will thoroughly clean your gutters without corroding them. Alternatively, washing up liquid or washing detergent work well.
Can I clean gutters myself?
If you’re wondering whether you should  hire a professional  or do the job yourself, we recommend assessing the job at hand and working out whether it requires a thorough or simple clean. For example, if there’s a large amount of debris, it’s worth spending a little extra to ensure a professional job.
When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews. Even better, those reviews are from your neighbours and checked by us to make sure they’re legitimate.

Cost to drill a borehole in the UK,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/cost-drill-borehole-uk/,Garden,"Cost to drill a borehole in the UK

In This Blog: How much does it cost to drill a borehole? Borehole cost factors to consider Top tips when getting a borehole quote FAQs A professionally installed borehole is essentially a private water supply, enabling you to access water off the mains. The cost of installing your borehole depends very much on the geology of your area, the depth of hole needed, the width, and your usage needs.
In this guide, we’ll cover a typical cost, as well as the factors that can affect the overall cost of your borehole, plus running expenses, payback time frame, water abstraction permission and top tips when getting a quote.
Cost provided
Cost range - low
Cost range - high
Cost of drilling a borehole, including lining, pump, chamber and pressure vessel
£10,000
£15,000
Cost of Hydrogeologist's survey
£220
£1,000
Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now How much does it cost to drill a borehole? The deeper your water supply, the greater the cost of accessing it and then creating a safe borehole for long-term use. Water bore drilling cost per metre will vary, but assuming your water lies at the average UK borehole depth of 60m, you can expect to pay between 
£10,220 – £16,000
 for a professional to install your borehole. This includes a Hydrogeologist’s survey, the cost of drilling, a pump, chamber and pressure vessel.
The cost of drilling a water borehole on your property will rise depending on how far the water needs to travel from the source to where you need it. The further it needs to go, the more pipework and groundwork you’ll require, plus you’ll probably need a more powerful pump. Ultimately, the greatest cost is the drilling and creation of your borehole. This cost will depend on where you are in the UK, which is why it’s a great idea to get a quote from a locally recommended tradesperson.

Find a borehole specialist near you  Borehole cost factors to consider If you’re right at the start of your borehole project, it pays to understand all the costs involved, beyond simply drilling a hole. You’ll need a geological survey, first of all, to determine the depth at which your water source is likely to lie. With this information, your recommended tradesperson can give you an indicative idea of the cost for the creation of a safe-to-use borehole. This will typically include:
Travel, equipment and set up
Drilling the borehole (depth and width will affect the cost)
Creating a chamber and lining it (the deeper it is, the more expensive it will be)
A pump
Water testing
Filtration requirements (depends on water quality, and is only known once water is tested)
Piping (covering the distance from borehole to usage point) Top tips when getting a borehole quote Get a survey from a recommended geological surveyor to get an accurate borehole depth
Always get a fixed price for the install, based on your specific needs and depth suggested by your survey
Make sure the tradesperson will reduce the cost if you hit water sooner
Get a clear cost per metre if they have to go deeper FAQs Do you need permission to drill a borehole?
You can use up to 20,000 litres of water from a borehole in the UK without the need for a licence, if you plan to use more than this, then an ‘abstraction licence’ is required from the  Environment Agency .
Is a borehole worth it?
As you’d expect, finding out whether a borehole is worth it or not is very much dependent on your individual situation. Your local geology, water depth, site access and usage will all come into play when determining whether you’ll save money in the long run by using a borehole over mains water. Depending on usage, payback on a professional installation by a tradesperson can be achieved in under 12 months – based on the equivalent cost of the mains water you would have used.
Are boreholes expensive?
Once installed by a recommended professional, a borehole doesn’t cost much to run. You should factor in the cost of electricity to run the pump, which will vary depending on the rate you pay. And also the cost of replacing any filters in your system. You might also want to create a sink fund to cover any future costs, such as pump replacement (typically after 10 years) or extending the supply to other locations on your property. Factoring in all of this, typically annual running costs of a 60m well could be around
 £150 a year

Cost of a snow guard for a roof,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/cost-snow-guard-for-roof/,Roof,"Cost of a snow guard for a roof

In This Blog: What’s the cost of a snow guard for a roof? Fitting snow guards  FAQs Whether you love or loathe the snow, it’s a pretty inevitable part of winter. While we don’t get much of it in the UK, when it does strike, the snow can cause chaos. And we’re not just talking about travel delays. We’re talking about roof avalanches.
Adding a snow guard to your roof is really important to prevent snow and hail from wreaking havoc on the upper structure of your property, loft, and brickwork, and is just as vital as  getting your chimney capped .
Snow guards help ice and snow completely melt and drift off your roof in small amounts rather than at the same time. If you don’t have one, then your roof may be prone to the sudden release of ice or snow all at once (a roof avalanche), which causes damage to your  skylights , lower roof area, guttering, and people who may be below your roof.

£25
Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now What’s the cost of a snow guard for a roof? The cost of a snow guard is about 
£50 – £70
 per guard. You can purchase lower-priced guards that clip under your roof slates for between 
£10 – £15
.
For professional installation, it’s best to contact your local roofer, as fitting snow guards can be a dangerous job.
It normally takes two tradespeople half a day to fit a snow guard and this will include the price of the guards. The average cost of installing snow guards can range from 
£200 – £500
 and may involve  scaffolding  and bridging.
However, we advise speaking to your local roofer, as they’ll have expert knowledge on how to perform the task correctly.
A  roofer’s hourly rate  is usually between 
£18 – £25
. Fitting snow guards Your local roofer will fit the snow guard onto the roof’s surface using a generous layer of silicone adhesive. This means that the guard is completely waterproof and weatherproof. Next, they’ll fit the snow guard to your roof by attaching screws to the roof joists.
For the snow guard to be as robust and durable as possible and for the adhesive to harden completely, it’ll need to be left alone for roughly 24 hours.

Find a snow guard fitter your neighbours recommend  FAQs What is a roof snow guard?
A roof snow guard helps control ice and snow so they slide off your property’s roof gradually. It also allows the snow and ice to melt entirely before dropping to the ground, preventing a roof avalanche (when snow and ice suddenly release from your roof).
The beauty of a snow guard is that it’ll catch the snow so it stays securely in one place until it’s melted and no longer a hazard.
Do roof snow guards work?
Yes, they work really well. When they’re positioned on a slanted roof, they stop the snow and ice from falling to the ground. In other words, they keep the snow and ice contained on top of your roof to stop it from falling on anyone or damaging your home. What’s more, snow guards evenly disperse the weight of ice and snow to prevent any destruction.
To get the best out of your snow guard, we recommend speaking to your  local roofer . They’ll install your snow guards so they’re fitted evenly over your roof to make sure the guard does its job properly.
Are snow guards really necessary?
Snow guards are necessary if you experience large quantities of snow and ice dropping from your roof. They will prevent you from potentially having to pay for damages caused by snow to your property and will also protect passers-by from falling snow.

How to turn a home into a rental property in 7 steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/turn-a-home-into-a-rental-property/,Living Room,"How to turn a home into a rental property in 7 steps

In This Blog: How to turn a home into a rental property Checklist for renting out a property for the first time (UK) FAQs So, you’re asking yourself, how do I turn my house into a rental property? You’re able to do this either through a buy-to-let mortgage or because you’ve paid for your house in full and now want to know how to turn your home into a rental property and start earning a rental income.
Thankfully, this blog has you covered. We’re going to take a deep dive into everything you need to know about your responsibilities when it comes to getting your house ready to rent, including the common pitfalls landlords face before welcoming new tenants.
So, read on for our top tips and expert advice in regard to your landlord obligations. And don’t forget to check out our blog:  Considerations before becoming a landlord in the UK  for more information. How to turn a home into a rental property Before you’re able to supplement your income by renting out your property, there are a few key considerations you need to take into account – both physically and financially. Read on for the top 7 steps to take to turn your home into a rental property. Checklist for renting out a property for the first time (UK) Step 1: Check whether you need a licence
Usually, you’ll need either a selective or additional licence before you can rent out your property. Check with your local authority before you make any changes to your property and be sure to purchase the right rental license.
Step 2: Get your Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)
To rent your property, you need to have an EPC rating of A-E to meet minimum energy standards (MEES). Otherwise, it’s illegal to rent out your house. The certificates last 10 years and also teach you ways to save money on your bills. Your tenants will also need a copy of this certificate before they move in.
Our  EPC cost guide  had everything you need to know about getting this certificate.
Step 3: Undertake fire and electrical checks
Making sure your home is safe and complies with the following regulations is paramount.
Furniture and Furnishings (Fire Safety) Regulations
Electrical Safety Standards in the Private Rented Sector (England) Regulations
For the latter, you’ll need to  hire a registered professional  to carry out your electrical safety checks every 5-years. They’ll be able to give you an EICR report that assures your tenants and insurers that you’re compliant and meeting your landlord obligations.
Check out our guide:  How much does an electrical safety check cost in 2021?  for more information.
Step 4: Undertake a gas safety check
As a responsible landlord, you’re legally required to carry out a gas safety check once a year. They require you to hire a registered Gas Safe engineer, who will supply you with a certificate that you need to give to your tenants once they move in.
Read our blog:  Gas safety for tenants: What you need to know  for more information.
Step 5: Install carbon monoxide and smoke detectors
Another legal requirement to fulfil your landlord obligations is to have a smoke alarm on every floor of your house. You’ll also need to install a carbon monoxide detector in rooms that have ‘solid fuel-burning appliances.’ For example, a kitchen with a wood-burning stove.
Here’s the  cost of carbon monoxide and smoke alarms .
Step 6: Take out landlord insurance
If you’ve gone down the buy-to-let route, taking out insurance is advised. Accidents happen, which is why purchasing cover that protects your home from damage costs is prudent.
Top tip
: Taking out specialised landlord insurance offers comprehensive cover that adequately protects your assets.
Read our  Buy to let guide for landlords  for more information.
Step 7: Clean up your property
The last thing you need to do before welcoming tenants is to make sure your property is clean, tidy, mould and infestation free. Be sure to get a pre-tenancy clean carried out before moving anyone in.
Once these steps are completed, congratulations! Your property is ready to rent out! Now all you need to do is screen potential tenants, write up a tenancy agreement, put their deposit in a protection scheme, give them a ‘ How to rent guide ‘ and consider carrying out a rental inventory upon check-in and check-out.

Hire a local surveyor your neighbours trust  FAQs How much can I rent my house for without paying tax?
You’re able to rent out your property for £1k per month tax-free. This is called a ‘property allowance.’ Anything after that requires you to fill out a self-assessment form and pay the appropriate tax rate on the income you earn.
Can I turn my current home into an investment property?
If you’re able to afford to retain ownership of one property while moving into another, turning your current home into an investment property is worth it. You’ll just need to check you’re allowed before you make the change. Your insurance and any current mortgage will be affected.
Can you rent out your house if you have a mortgage?
You will only be able to rent out your house with the written approval of your mortgage supplier. In this case, a ‘consent for lease’ needs to be agreed upon.
Can you let a property without a gas safety certificate?
Absolutely not. You will need to  hire a gas safe engineer  to carry out checks once every year. Failure to do so is an illegal offence.
Is an EICR a legal requirement for landlords?
Since 1st July 2020, EICRs are a legal requirement for all new tenancies and fixed-term renewals. They’re a part of the Electrical Safety Standards for the private rental sector in the UK.

How to clean an oven in 3 stages,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/clean-an-oven/,Kitchen,"How to clean an oven in 3 stages

In This Blog: How to clean an oven Alternative methods for cleaning your oven FAQs Avoid a culinary crime scene with this how to clean an oven guide. We let you in on the top tips, tricks and cleaning hacks to make sure your oven stays at peak performance.
We understand how ovens are easily overlooked in a household, leading to crust, residue, grease and grime that need some extra elbow grease to remove. So, if you’ve noticed a build-up of dirt; an odour when you turn on your oven, or smoke that isn’t due to poor culinary skills, follow this guide to fix the issue.
Note:
 If you’re curious about hiring a cleaner to tackle this job for you, check out our guide:  How much does a professional oven clean cost in 2021?  Otherwise, read on for our DIY solutions. How to clean an oven Cleaning your oven as often as possible avoids longer-term build-up. However, we get that life is busy and time is a commodity. So, aim to clean your oven at least once a month to keep it in top condition. There are several methods you can use to do this, such as:
Warm soapy water and a microfibre cloth
A citrus-based, all-purpose cleaner and microfibre cloth
Strong paper towels and a homemade vinegar spray
Methylated spirits and paper towels
Tools you’ll need for the job
Before we get started, add these items to your cleaning arsenal and get ready to tackle those stains.
Gloves
Bucket
Washing up liquid
Scouring pad
Baking soda
White vinegar
Glass scraper
Microfibre cloth/s
No-scratch scouring pads
Glass cleaner
Lemons (this will make sense soon!)
Tool box

Hire a cleaner your neighbours trust 
Stage 1: How to clean an oven door
This section is going to cover how to clean an oven glass door. As most ovens have a cool-to-touch glass pane on the exterior and an inner pane (or two), dirt and food often find their way through the cracks. Consequently, you might need to remove the door and panes to scrub away any grease or grime.
To clean the glass, fill up a bucket with hot water and washing-up liquid. Put on your gloves before dipping your microfibre cloth into the water. Give the glass a wipe down to dislodge the dirt and repeat until the grime is gone. If this doesn’t work, try a glass cleaner too. However, if you’re stuck with baked-on residue, you might need a glass scraper. Always check this is safe. For example, if there’s a coating on the glass, a scraper might damage this protective layer.
Stage 2: How to clean the roof of an oven
As the roof of your oven is at an awkward angle, cleaning it is a little trickier. Thankfully, there are two easy ways to clean the roof of your oven that don’t require the skills of a contortionist to complete. The first is to use a gel cleaner and brush it on with a paintbrush. The other is to put an ovenproof tray filled with hot water and lemon and leave it on a low heat for about an hour. This helps to dislodge any stubborn grime, making it easier to wipe away with a sponge and some warm soapy water.
Stage 3: How to clean an oven tray
There are several ways to clean an oven tray. However, we found the following method by far the superior out of all the ones we’ve tried.
Pour 1 cup of vinegar and ½ a cup of baking soda into your sink and top up with hot water
Submerge the baking tray and leave to soak for around 30-40 minutes
Use your microfibre cloth or a non-scratch scouring pad to scrub the tray
Repeat until your tray is as good as new!
Once you’ve completed these 3-stages, you can sit back and enjoy your spotless oven.

Hire a cleaner your neighbours trust  Alternative methods for cleaning your oven How to steam clean an oven
Steam is an excellent cleaning agent and a great way to wash items that aren’t easily removed. When it comes to steam cleaning your oven, the easiest way to do this is to follow these steps:
Fill an oven-safe bowl with water and place it on the middle shelf
Turn your oven to 180 celsius and leave the water to do its job for around an hour
Remove the bowl and let your oven cool down before you try to clean it
Take your sponge or non-scratch scouring pad and scrub your oven until it’s clean. (The steam should have loosened any dirt, making your job 10x easier!)
How to clean an oven with baking soda
People who want to know how to clean an oven without chemicals tend to learn how to clean an oven with baking soda and vinegar. This is because this tried and tested method can be completed using household items. To clean your oven using baking soda, follow these 7 steps:
Mix ½ a cup of baking soda and ½ a cup of water to make a paste
Remove your oven racks and any other items
Paint on the paste over the entirety of your oven (layer it on tougher areas)
Leave overnight or for at least 12 hours
Use hot soapy water and your microfibre cloth to clean off the paste
Add white vinegar to a spray bottle and spray throughout your oven (this gets ride of any baking soda residue)
Wipe clean with a damp rag and leave to dry

Hire a cleaner your neighbours trust  FAQs What is the easiest way to clean an oven?
Any of our above methods will make cleaning your oven a breeze. However, industrial cleaning agents or a  professional cleaner  are the easiest routes to take if you want a quick fix.
How do I get burnt stuff off the bottom of my oven?
Use our above baking soda method to make a paste and cover the bottom of your oven with a thick layer of the mixture. Leave overnight before cleaning it off with a non-scratch scouring pad and some warm soapy water.
How do I deep clean my oven?
Our steam cleaning method offers an effective deep clean. However,  hiring a professional  to come and restore your oven to its former glory guarantees a perfect finish.
Should I hire a professional?
If you’re wondering whether you should  hire an oven cleaner  or do the job yourself, we recommend assessing the job at hand and working out whether it requires a thorough or simple clean. For example, if you’re looking for an end-of-tenancy clean, landlords often check the oven and other appliances before giving you your deposit back. In this case, it’s worth spending a little extra to ensure a professional job.
When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews. Even better, those reviews are from your neighbours and checked by us to make sure they’re legitimate. Not only that, but if you book one of our members for the job, we  guarantee their work,  which gives you the extra peace of mind and security that you and your house is in safe hands.

How much does it cost to build a microbrewery?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/cost-to-build-microbrewery/,"Garden, Kitchen","How much does it cost to build a microbrewery?

In This Blog: How much does it cost to build a microbrewery? The average microbrewery set up cost Cost of microbrewery equipment FAQs Brits have been brewing beer at home ever since it was created almost 7,000 years ago!
In the UK today, homebrewing is taking the world by storm. If you’re a modern-day brewer and produce quality beer, you may be thinking about launching a microbrewery as a new venture. Great, but there’s a few things you need to think about before starting your business.
Opening a microbrewery will involve obtaining a government permit. Setting up a microbrewery also involves a lot of work and money before getting started.
To help you budget, let’s take a look at a rough cost estimate to build your very own microbrewery.
Cost provided item
Average cost
1 BBL package including kettle, masher, exchanger, pumps, hot liquor tank, controls
£20,000
Optional: 2 brite tanks, 2 fermentors and one glycol chiller
£15,000
Optional: a yeast keg/brink
£1,000
Delivery, lifting & fitting equipment
£3,000
Qualified electrician
£1,000
Cost to start a commercial microbrewery
£370,000-£750,000
Commercial microbrewery set up cost
£1,000-£1,000,000
Build a commercial microbrewery
£10,000-£80,000
Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now How much does it cost to build a microbrewery? To build a microbrewery, you can expect to pay anywhere from 
£1,000 
for a small online home brewing kit all the way through to 
£80,000+
 for a commercial one. This is a rough estimate only, so speak to your local builder for more accurate prices.
It’s important to note that costs vary significantly based on where you live and the production output required. A small start-up microbrewery producing 1 BBL (288 pints) would fit in one room, with all procedures being handled by one person. However, microbreweries can go up to 30 BBL (10,376 pints).
In our cost table, we’ve excluded building costs, rental costs, license costs, operational costs, raw materials, bottles, and kegs, as the costs we’ve provided are based on brand new equipment only.
Top tip: 
A start-up microbrewery can save costs by only buying essential second-hand equipment. The average microbrewery set up cost On average, you can expect to pay 
£1,000 
for an online home brewing kit. However, things can get pretty costly – you could fork out as much as 
£1,000,000,
 though, for a 30BBL facility, but this includes building costs.

Find builders your neighbours recommend  Cost of microbrewery equipment A 1 BBL package including a kettle, masher, exchanger, pumps, hot liquor tank, and controls will set you back 
£20,000.
If you like, you can also purchase two brite tanks, two fermenters, and one glycol chiller for roughly 
£15,000
, while a yeast keg/brink will add a further 
£1,000
 to your bill.
Then, you have to factor in the delivery, lifting, and fitting of the equipment, which is around 
£3,000,
 plus hiring a qualified local electrician, which can set you back an additional
 £1,000.
So, in total, microbrewery equipment will cost you 
£40,000. FAQs How much does it cost to start a microbrewery?
As mentioned above, for a small home microbrewery, you’ll most likely pay about 
£40,000,
 all told.
To start a commercial microbrewery, you’d probably pay between 
£370,000-£750,000.
 However, this is an estimate only. A local tradesperson will be able to provide a quote based on the size of the microbrewery and the special equipment needed to complete the job.
How profitable is a microbrewery?
A microbrewery is incredibly profitable, so long as you plan it well and have robust financial foundations in place.
In the UK, the law states you can’t give away any homebrew if it’ll be drunk on any premises other than yours. Even if you slip a couple of homemade beer bottles into your friend’s bag, theoretically, you’re breaking the law.
Even so, it’s not very likely you’ll be sued for such a trivial offence. Chances are, it’ll go unnoticed.
That being said, if you want to go beyond simply offering a beer to a friend as a birthday present, you’ll need to get a license from the HMRC. This consists of two elements:
A licence for the premises from which the drinks will be marketed
A personal license
How much does it cost to set up a home brewery?
To set up a home brewery, you can expect to pay about 
£40,000.
 However, this is for a small microbrewery only. Commercial microbreweries, on the other hand, can cost up to 
£1,000,000.
How much does microbrewery equipment cost?
A 1 BBL package includes a kettle, masher, exchanger, pumps, hot liquor tank, and controls – 
£20,000.
 Brite tanks, two fermenters, and one glycol chiller – 
£15,000.
Yeast keg/brink – 
£1,000.
The delivery, lifting, and fitting of the equipment will cost a further 
£3,000
 then you’ll need to hire a qualified local electrician that can cost roughly 
£1,000.
 So, in total, microbrewery equipment will cost you 
£40,000.
How much does it cost to set up a microbrewery in the UK?
Use our cost table as a guide to help understand the standard costs involved in setting up a microbrewery in the UK. The variables include the equipment for the microbrewery, delivery, lifting, and fitting of the equipment, and the cost of a professional electrician.
While setting up a microbrewery isn’t cheap, it doesn’t have to cost the earth, either.

How much does it cost to build townhouses?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/cost-build-townhouses/,Tag Not Found,"How much does it cost to build townhouses?

In This Blog: What’s a townhouse? How much does it cost to build townhouses? How much does it cost to build 2 townhouses? FAQs If you want a home that blends family living with apartment-style living, townhouses are a great choice. Because of their distinctive style and layout, you can build townhouses in smaller spaces than if you were to build the same number of detached residences.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Townhouses tend to be less expensive to build than detached houses, and their flexible, multi-floored living space is sought-after by growing families who appreciate the multi-floor layout.
We’ve broken down how much it costs to build a townhouse so that you can plan your project. What’s a townhouse? A townhouse is a property with multiple floors that shares several walls with neighbouring houses but has its own entrance.
A townhouse translates to – quite literally – a house in a town. Historically, it was once the residence of an important wealthy person or a member of the aristocracy in a main or capital city. Such folk would own grander, bigger properties across the UK, whereas the townhouse was purely where they lived when in town, usually during social seasons.
As is the case in most cities, it was hard to get enough space, so townhouses weren’t detached like rural townhouses. They were distinguished by the fact that they shared common walls and were identical to their neighbour.
Up until recently, townhouses have become refurbished and are massively popular among city dwellers. How much does it cost to build townhouses? The best way to get a general estimate is to think about the cost to build a townhouse per square metre.
As a ballpark figure, you can expect to pay anything from 
£1,400
–
£3,000
per m2.
 Townhouses typically range from 60 to 100 metres square, so you can expect to pay an average of between 
£90,000 –
£300,000. How much does it cost to build 2 townhouses? The typical size of two townhouses is around 160 m2, meaning the average cost of building two townhouses can range from 
£224,000
–
£480,000.
These costs are estimates obtained from average costs, so for an accurate cost for your project, we recommend getting multiple quotes from tradespeople near you.

Find a builder your neighbours recommend  FAQs How much does it cost to build a 4 bedroom townhouse?
If you’re planning to build a four-bedroom townhouse, then you’re most likely looking at a property in the region of 100 m2. That means the average cost of building a four bedroom townhouse can range from around 
£140,000
 – 
£300,000.
How much does it cost to build a 6 unit townhouse?
With an estimated size of around 90 m2, the cost of building a six-unit townhouse – by unit, we mean a three-bed, with a kitchen, lounge, and bathroom – can range from around 
£126,000
–
£270,000.
Understandably, that cost can vary hugely, depending on the specifics of the construction and the fixtures and fittings you want in your finished townhouse.
Are townhouses cheaper than houses?
Townhouses are generally cheaper than detached houses because costs are shared (the party walls and connection costs), and you’re more likely to benefit from economies of scale.
How much land do you need to build 3 townhouses?
Assuming each townhouse is 80 m2 and the back garden or outside space is 10 m2, you’ll most probably need land that’s roughly 270 m2 to build three townhouses.

Air conditioning engineer training,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/air-conditioning-engineer-training/,Tag Not Found,"Air conditioning engineer training

During the warmer months in the UK, our homes and businesses can become stifling and extremely uncomfortable, which can have a knock-on effect on our home and work lives. One of the ways to remedy this issue is by installing air conditioning. From hotels to offices and houses, many buildings in the UK depend on air conditioning to get them through the summer each year.
Thanks to advances in technology, air conditioning is becoming more accessible, which means that demand is rising. So, what better time to start your air conditioning engineer training?

You’ll also receive a salary whilst you are training, great if you have other commitments. An apprenticeship can take up to 4 years while you build your knowledge and experience level preparing you for your new career.

How much do UK air conditioning engineers earn?
Once you’ve completed your course, your salary could increase, and you’ll hopefully start moving up the career ladder. Remember, the more experience, training and skill you have, the higher your air conditioning engineer salary will be. According to  Indeed , you’ll earn an average of £33,500 per year or just over £17 an hour.
Can I take UK air conditioning and refrigeration courses online?

Cost to remove a squirrel from an attic,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/cost-remove-squirrel-from-attic/,Loft,"Cost to remove a squirrel from an attic

In This Blog: What’s the average cost to remove squirrels from the attic? Do squirrels leave the attic during the day? FAQs Do you think you have squirrels in your loft space? They have become very common across the UK and are as much of an annoyance as mice and rats. Because squirrels are pros at climbing trees, they can cause more damage than other pests, chewing through outside furnishings such as woodwork, wadding, pipework, and guttering and they can cause even more issues if they manage to get into attics.
As well as carrying diseases, they’re a lot more destructive than the likes of rats when confronted. In which case, you’ll need to reach out to an expert  pest controller  to get rid of them.
Below, we’ll take you through how much it costs to remove a squirrel(s) from your attic, including what methods are used and more.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now What’s the average cost to remove squirrels from the attic? The cost to get rid of squirrels from your attic is roughly 
£90. 
Typically, this involves two visits from a professional pest controller, during which they’ll install traps and baits. You can also ask your pest controller service to erect squirrel proofing which could set you back a further 
£150+
.
Once the treatment has been carried out, your pest controller will need to proof the property to stop a whole family of squirrels from moving in.
Biocide treatment
Given that squirrels can pollute attics, they present a health hazard. Most pest controllers offer an additional service where they apply biocide spray to your attic or wherever they’re present to remove the chance of disease.
On average, this will cost 
£90 
+ VAT, but this depends on where you live. In serious cases, you may need to ask your local professional  loft insulation service  to replace the wadding in your attic space. Do squirrels leave the attic during the day? Yes, squirrels tend to leave the attic when it starts to feel too warm. Because loft spaces get warm very fast, squirrels won’t stick around during the warmer parts of the day, especially in the summer months.
Usually, you’ll hear squirrels scurrying around in your loft in the morning or early evening. Often, they’ll scamper around at dusk and again at twilight. Squirrels enjoy working either on their own on in groups to get into your loft. If they choose to work in a group, they’ll work in shifts, chewing from the inside of your loft to create their entry point.

Hire your local pest control specialist  FAQs How much does it cost to remove a squirrel from the attic?
As mentioned above, it’ll cost anything from 
£90
–
£150
 or more to have a squirrel removed from your loft space.
Will squirrels leave the attic on their own?
Unfortunately, squirrels won’t always leave the attic on their own, especially if they’ve given birth to a litter. If this is the case, you’ll regularly hear one of the parent squirrels leaving and entering the loft space to bring food to their babies.
You can stop this situation from happening by driving squirrels out as soon as you suspect they’ve arrived, to prevent them from setting up shop and giving birth. If you decide to cover up the final access point yourself once the parent squirrel leaves, it’s crucial to recruit the help of a professional pest management company, even if the squirrels are no longer alive.
The best way to remove squirrels from your loft or around the house is to get in touch with a  pest control service . Not only will they know how to get rid of these pests, but they’ll also know how to make sure they – and other pests – remain outside.
Do squirrels stay in the attic at night?
If they’ve made a nest in your loft space, then squirrels will stay in your attic at night. You probably won’t hear them, though, as they aren’t active during the night, preferring to sleep like us. They’re active during the day, particularly at sunrise and at sunset when they’re scrambling around for food.

How to fit a sink,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/fit-sink/,"Bathroom, Kitchen","How to fit a sink

In This Blog: How to fit a kitchen sink How to fit a sink in a worktop How to install a bathroom sink How to fit a vanity unit How to fit a wall hung basin Hiring a professional How much does a sink cost to be installed by a professional? Which tradesperson should I use to fit my sink? FAQs Looking to replace a sink in your home? We’ve put together a step by step guide to help you fit your new kitchen or bathroom sink.
Whether you want to know how to fit a ceramic sink or how to fit a butler sink, you’ll need a few tools. Make sure you have the following:
Bucket
Adjustable wrench
Pliers
Screwdriver
Utility knife
Caulk/silicone sealant How to fit a kitchen sink Once you have your tools and materials ready, use the below steps to get the best results possible:
Switch off the water supply to your sink. You can often do this by turning valves under the sink, but you may need to turn off the mains water supply to your home
Next, turn on your sink taps to drain any leftover water and position your bucket under the water pipes to catch any remaining drips
Use an adjustable wrench to detach the water supply lines 
(please note that copper pipes
are flexible and may twist when you detach the water supply lines, so make sure to securely hold the pipes to prevent this)
If you have a waste disposal unit, then make sure this is turned off and disconnected
Next, use a pair of pliers to detach the drainpipe and u-bend (make sure to use a bucket to catch any drips from the drainpipe and u-bend)
Remove any sink clips with a screwdriver
Run a utility knife around the edges of the sink to cut through the sealant, and move your sink elsewhere. Use this opportunity to also remove any old sealant and dirt
Lift your new kitchen sink and position it in place and use caulk to seal around the edges of the sink
Connect the underside of your sink to the clips using a screwdriver
Now you can fit your taps. You may need to use a nut to secure these in place
You can then start to reconnect the pipes under your sink. Begin with the tap hoses and attach these to the mains pipework
Next, connect the waste pipework and waste plug
Finally, reconnect your waste disposal unit and you can then turn your water supply back on and check for leaks How to fit a sink in a worktop An inset kitchen sink is designed to blend seamlessly with your kitchen worktops and when installed correctly, will look sleek and modern. The key to a perfect installation is making sure that the sink is the right size. That’s why it’s so important to measure twice before ordering your new sink.
It’s also essential that you remember to take your time creating a seal when fitting your sink in a worktop. You’ll want to use silicone sealant and a putty knife to create an even, smooth line around the sink to prevent any leaks. You can always wipe away any excess sealant so make sure to use a good amount to create a watertight seal.

Find a plumber trusted by your neighbours  How to install a bathroom sink The main difference between fitting a bathroom sink to a kitchen sink is that you don’t need to worry about fitting the sink into a worktop. Generally, bathroom sinks are easier to fit because of this.
Although, if you choose a floating sink, you’ll need assistance when it comes to holding the sink in place while you attach it to the wall. Pedestal sinks on the other hand are much simpler to install.
If you do plan to attach your sink to the wall, please skip ahead to our ‘how to fit a wall hung basin’ section. How to fit a vanity unit Vanity units are a great addition to any bathroom and are not too difficult to fit. It’s really important that you install your vanity unit at the correct height to make using it effortless. We’d suggest a height that falls between 85cm and 92cm.
If you’re unsure how to fit a vanity unit, just use the below steps:
Remove your old sink
Build your vanity unit by following the manufacturer’s guidelines and lay it upside down before securely fitting the feet
Measure where you want your vanity unit to sit and check there are no pipes or cables in the wall
You can then attach your brackets to the wall and fix the vanity unit in place
Next, install the taps that you choose to use with your sink and attach the water supply hoses
Slot in the waste and overflow fittings, then connect the drain and overflow pipe
You can then fit the basin to the vanity unit and secure using silicone
Finally, check all your pipes are properly connected before turning the water supply back on How to fit a wall hung basin Installing a wall hung basin can be challenging as these units are quite heavy. That means this job will be much easier if you have one or two strong friends to help you.
Use the below steps to fit a wall hung basin:
Hold the sink in place and mark where it’ll sit on your wall. Use a spirit level to ensure your sink is level
Line the brackets up on your wall, then use a pencil to mark where the holes are. You’ll then need to drill in your bathroom wall
Next, push your wall plugs into the hole and using a screwdriver, attach the brackets to the wall
You can then hang your basin up and connect the pipes before switching your water supply back on

Find a plumber trusted by your neighbours  Hiring a professional While it’s possible to install a sink yourself, there’s no guarantee you’ll get the results you’re hoping for.

You can even view past customer reviews on our member’s profiles that are checked to make sure they’re from real customers.

Use our  free search feature  to find a qualified professional today. FAQs Can you install a sink yourself?
With a little DIY experience you can use this guide to successfully install a sink yourself. If you’re struggling though, or want to remove the risk of errors, don’t be afraid to reach out to a professional for assistance.
Do you need a plumber to install a sink?

How to fit an oven,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/fit-oven/,Kitchen,"How to fit an oven

In This Blog: How to fit a gas oven How to fit an electric oven How to fit a built-in oven How to install a built-in oven and hob FAQs Professional oven installation How much does oven repair and installation cost? Which tradesperson do I need? Wondering how to fit an oven? Whether you need a replacement oven, a new oven, or are using electricity or gas, we’ve got all the details below. How to fit a gas oven The below steps cover how to fit a gas oven but please be aware that connecting your oven to your gas supply will 
need to be done by a  professional . Alternatively, you can make the connections but not switch the gas supply back on until it has been checked.
To fit a gas oven, you’ll need the following tools:
Flexible gas line
Street elbow
Gas leak detector
Pipe fittings
Teflon tape
Leak detector spray
Gas cock
End connector fittings
Once you have all the tools you need to hand, start by turning off the gas supply to your home, or using a  professional  to do so. Then, use the below steps to fit your new oven:
With the gas supply switched off, you’ll need to begin by disconnecting your old oven. You can do this by detaching all the lines going into it
Next, use Teflon tape to cover the pipe joint, winding the tape in a clockwise direction
Then, wrap the connector with tape and attach it to the gas line
Screw the street elbow to the gas port on your oven. Make sure not to overtighten the street elbow or you risk a gas leak
You can then tighten the nuts on the end connector fittings
Turn your gas supply back on and light your gas burners 
(you will need to have a  Gas Safe Registered Engineer  check your connections before turning your gas supply on and using your oven)
Cover the joints you fitted with leak detector spray and wait to see if there are any bubbles
If bubbles appear, this means there’s a leak that needs to be dealt with ASAP
If there are no bubbles, you can go ahead and move your oven back into place
We strongly recommend you hire a professional to fit your gas oven from start to finish, especially if you aren’t confident with DIY. You will need to have a Gas Safe Registered engineer to turn on the gas supply and check the connection, so we recommend having them do the whole thing.

Find a trusted local oven installer  How to fit an electric oven Installing an electric oven is a slightly different process to fitting a gas oven. Before you start fitting your new oven, you will need to check what fuse it needs. This is an important step to make sure your oven wiring doesn’t overheat and cause issues.
Wondering how to fit an electric oven? Just use the following steps:
Turn off the electricity supply to your oven
Pull your old oven away from the wall and detach it before moving it out of the way while you work
Ensure you have the right type of fuse, then install a double pole isolating switch (if you don’t currently have one behind your oven)
Also, check that your oven will be less than 2 metres away from the oven control unit
Make sure you have a thick enough cable; this will usually come with your new oven
Attach the cable to the back of your oven, connecting the different wires to their ports
Now for safety, we’d 
recommend having your electrical connections checked by an  electrician  before proceeding
De-energise your oven by switching on the double pole isolator switch
You can then move your new oven into place
Check the voltage of your oven control unit to make sure no power is flowing through the unit
Attach your oven to the oven control unit by pushing the different wires into the right ports
Secure the wires in place using the insulation bit, then switch the oven on and check it is working properly
Top tip:
 Make sure you install your oven in a location that won’t cause issues. For example, as ovens reach a high heat, they can affect wallpaper, shelves and anything positioned above them. How to fit a built-in oven Built-in ovens are designed to seamlessly blend into your kitchen. As such, you should always measure twice to ensure that your new oven will fit perfectly in its dedicated space before purchasing the appliance. Once you’re happy the oven is the right size, ensure to use heat resistant plates to protect your surrounding kitchen surfaces.
Depending on whether your oven is electric or gas, you’ll need to follow the above instructions to learn how to fit a built-in oven. Once connected, you can simply slot the new oven into its space and screw it in place. How to install a built-in oven and hob Now you’ve installed your oven, the next thing to think about is the hob. It’s really important to make sure that the space around your hob (the hot zone) is unrestricted. This means checking there are no shelves, outlets, wallpaper, and any other obstructions.
As with fitting an electric oven, ensure that you have sufficient electrical connections in place. Fitting your hob is then quite simple. Just apply tape along the edges of the hob and attach the clips that come with the hob in the right positions. You can then lower the hob into place and check it’s flush with your worktop, making sure the clips are engaged.

Find a trusted local oven installer  FAQs Do you need an electrician to install an oven?
Whilst you may be able to install your electric oven yourself, getting an electrician to check your work and connections is recommended. That is unless you have training and experience to do this yourself.
Can you install an oven yourself?
This will depend on the type of oven and connections. For a gas oven, you’ll need a Gas Safe Registered Engineer to make the final connections. When it comes to installing an electric oven yourself, if any new wiring is required, you should always hire an electrician to do the job safely.
How easy is it to install an oven?
Depending on your level of experience, any training you have and the type of oven you’re installing, it can be quite complex to install an oven. Our guide should help to simplify the process but if you feel confused or unsure of how to proceed, we’d recommend hiring a professional to do the work for you.
Is it hard to replace a built-in oven?
Built-in ovens come in a range of different brands, styles, and sizes to fit most kitchens. This means usually it isn’t hard to replace a built-in oven. Professional oven installation Learning how to fit an oven can be tricky, especially if extensive work is required to improve the connections. This means DIY beginners may struggle with this project so don’t worry if you feel confused or lost. The best option, in this case, is to look into hiring an expert to do the installation for you.

This should help to give you peace of mind that you’re hiring the right person for your job. Just  input your postcode  and we’ll connect you to experts near you. How much does oven repair and installation cost? If your oven’s in relatively good condition but suddenly stops working, it may be possible to get it repaired rather than buying an entirely new appliance. Of course, if the oven is old and run down, it’s usually not worth paying for repairs, and instead, you’ll need to buy a replacement.
To learn more about fixing broken ovens, check out our  oven repair cost guide . With prices and guidance, this should help you to make a decision about how to tackle your broken oven. For reference, the average cost of a gas oven repair is 
£78
.

What rooms do I want to renovate?
Are there any issues that need fixing first?
What do I want the finished result to look like?
For example, if you want to  renovate your bathroom  by turning it into a  wet room , you’ll need to consider the plumbing, layout and any waterproofing required.
Read our  How to plan a house renovation  and  House renovation checklist  guides before you get started.

Find building surveyors your neighbours recommend  How do you calculate a renovation budget? To get an accurate cost for any type of renovation, you will need to hire a  surveyor  or builder to carry out a thorough inspection. However, our following cost guides will give you a general idea of what prices to expect for each type of renovation. How much does a loft conversion cost? Bathroom remodel cost guide Bedroom extension cost guide Wet room installation cost guide Renovate kitchen cost Barn conversion cost guide House renovation project manager cost guide Beach hut renovation cost Laundry room remodel cost Garage extension cost guide How much does a garage conversion cost in 2021?

The best thing to do is to search through our  cost guides  to get a good idea of the cost for the projects you want to complete. We have hundreds of cost guides for you to read!
Once you’ve worked out the high-level costs associated with your renovation, the next step is to start budgeting the smaller aspects. And don’t forget to update your budget as you go so you’re not left with any nasty surprises when the work starts.
This includes costs for accessories, paint, furniture and any further labour. It’s the small touches that transform your home, so don’t leave them out! How can I afford to remodel my home? Once you’ve worked out your budget and added on some extra contingency for any unexpected works, it’s time to collect a few quotes from the relevant tradespeople. Be sure to ask several builders, electricians, plumbers and painters/decorators to get some well-rounded offers before committing to one professional.
We highly recommend  hiring a local expert  your neighbours know and trust. When you hire one of our trusted members, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews. Even better, those reviews are from your neighbours and checked by us to make sure they’re legitimate.
If you book one of our members for the job, we  guarantee their work,  which gives you extra peace of mind and security that you and your house is in safe hands. Doing it this way also avoids you going over budget for potential mistakes that happen when you hire unregulated workers.
If you’ve tallied up your budget and it still seems too steep, then we recommend carefully reviewing your budget to see where you can save money. Sometimes we need to make a few compromises on materials and layouts to make our dream home affordable.

Find building surveyors your neighbours recommend  Should I hire a professional? If you’re wondering whether you  should hire a contractor or find individual trades  to support your house renovation, we recommend getting quotes from both and choosing the most affordable option.

Considerations before becoming a landlord in the UK,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/become-landlord-uk/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Considerations before becoming a landlord in the UK

In This Blog: Wondering how to become a landlord? Advantages of becoming a landlord Tips for becoming a landlord for the first time Typical landlord costs Looking for professional help? Which tradespeople should you use for the job? How much does a landlord safety certificate cost? Becoming a landlord can be a rewarding experience, but it can also be very challenging. You’ll need support and advice to help guide you, especially when you’re just getting started. That’s why we’ve created this guide on how to become a UK landlord.
We’ve covered the advantages of becoming a landlord and given some handy tips and the costs involved. Wondering how to become a landlord? The truth is, you’ll need to do a little research to ensure you aren’t missing anything important.
Below we’ve put together some of the steps you’ll need to follow:
Budget for essential costs (more on this later).
Find the right property.
If necessary, apply for a buy to let mortgage.
Apply for landlord insurance.
Choose whether to manage the property yourself or through a management agency.
Bring the property up to code, ensuring that it meets the regulations for fire safety. This includes checking the gas and electrical connections plus installing fire alarms and carbon monoxide detectors.
Finally, find tenants.

Get trusted landlord reports and safety checks  Advantages of becoming a landlord While it’s true that being a landlord can be difficult at times, there are many benefits to becoming a landlord.
The main advantage is that you’ll make a profit each month. You can also look forward to the following extra benefits:
The freedom to run your property business your way.
Tax breaks on things like repairs, gardening and decorating.
Financial security – you can depend on your rented property to bring in a certain profit each month.
Owning an asset. Tips for becoming a landlord for the first time Becoming a landlord for the first time can be a little scary but looking at the bigger picture will help you to see the amazing potential that comes with renting out a property. If you’re feeling a little in over your head, use the below tips to get the most out of this opportunity:
Advertise your property online to find new tenants quickly.
Remember to see your rental property as a business, not as a home. Many landlords waste money on unnecessary cosmetic renovations.
Make sure to screen future tenants and conduct background and credit checks.
Hire a property management company to deal with the day to day running of your property.
Ask your tenants to get contents insurance to cover damaged possessions.
Be realistic about the rent you charge. Ensure it covers your outgoings and leaves you with a profit but don’t overcharge or you’ll struggle to find tenants.
Always ensure you have a legal rental agreement signed by both parties.
Consider allowing your tenants to pay their rent online. Typical landlord costs As a landlord, there are a few different costs you’ll need to budget for. If you don’t prepare for these outgoings, you may find yourself in a difficult situation that’ll affect the running of your property. Some of the key costs for landlords include:
A deposit
Stamp duty
Maintenance costs
Mortgage fees
Agency fees
Mortgage payments
Work that needs to be done on the property including refurbishment costs, repair costs and the price of bringing it up to code Looking for professional help? Running a property comes with a range of demands in order to keep your tenants safe and secure in their homes. You may have DIY experience, but there are instances where you’ll need professional help to keep your property well maintained and above board. For example, it’s essential that the electrics and gas in the property are up to standard at all times.
So, how do you find quality tradespeople to work in your property? Well, why not consider going through Checkatrade? We thoroughly check all our members to ensure you get the best service possible every time. Just use our  free search feature  to connect with experts you can trust, who are recommended by local customers.
Becoming a landlord can be a complicated process so it’s likely you’ll need advice and support on your journey. Two fantastic places to find helpful articles and guidance are the  Landlord Association  and the  National Residential Landlords Association  websites. With help on key issues like mortgages, tenant checks and taxes, you’ll be sure to find the answers to your burning questions. Which tradespeople should you use for the job? This really depends on the job that needs doing in your property. For example, any electrical work should be done by a qualified electrician and gas work needs to be done by a Gas Safe Registered Engineer. Alternatively, a general builder can help with a wide range of renovations while a decorator can manage small internal design changes. How much does a landlord safety certificate cost? As we mentioned previously in this guide, there are a few legal requirements for landlords that need to be followed. These include gas and electrical safety checks. As a landlord, you’ll need up to date certificates showing your property is safe for tenants to live in. While these do come at a cost, it’s worth it to have peace of mind that your tenants aren’t at risk.
To learn more, check out our  gas safety certificate cost guide  and our  electrical safety check cost guide . There you’ll find prices, how to apply for these checks and the reasons why they’re so important. For reference, the average cost of a gas safe certificate is £80, and the average cost of an electrical safety certificate is £212.50.

Buy to let guide for landlords,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/buy-to-let-guide-landlords/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Buy to let guide for landlords

In This Blog: What does buy to let mean? Are there any buy to let rules? Handy buy to let tips Buy to let pitfalls to avoid Finding a qualified professional How much does property maintenance cost? Which tradespeople should you use for the job? Choosing to invest in property is a big decision with huge potential. This buy to let guide is aimed at all landlords and we’ll be taking a closer look at the current buy to let rules. We’ll also be covering pitfalls to avoid and giving you some great tips to help with your new buy to let property. What does buy to let mean? Buy to let means that instead of purchasing a home to live in, the homeowner chooses to purchase the property with a view to renting it out. This homeowner then becomes a landlord to tenants who live in the property and pay a regular amount of rent.
Buy to let mortgages are also available for landlords who can’t afford to buy the property outright. Then in order to make a profit, the rent on the home is set at a higher rate to the mortgage repayments. Are there any buy to let rules? If you’re considering investing in a buy to let property, you may be wondering whether there are any specific buy to let rules. In fact, there are a few important regulations for buy to let that landlords should be aware of. These include:
Right to rent rules
Notice period rules
Eviction rules
Electrical safety rules
New regulations also came into play in 2021 surrounding taxes, tax relief and tax rates. For more information on the new 2021 buy to let tax rules, check out  Simply businesses’  informative article. Alternatively, there’s a detailed guide covering all the important rules for landlords on  Which’s  website. Handy buy to let tips If you’re looking for buy to let advice, this section is perfect to give you a helping hand. This is especially useful if you’re purchasing your first buy to let property.
If you’re still a little unsure about whether buy to let is for you, consider using the below tips to ensure your success as a landlord:
Make sure you read through the key buy to let tax rules. While this can feel a little dull, it’s important you’re up to date with all the relevant regulations surrounding buy to lets.
If you’re planning to sign up for a buy to let mortgage, ensure you have a large enough deposit first. Also, ensure that you’ll make a profit once your mortgage and any running costs have been paid.
Don’t forget that you’ll need to dedicate time and energy to managing your buy to let. You can save yourself a few headaches by hiring a property management company, but this will eat into your profits, and you’ll still need to have some input in the process.
It may be more difficult to find a buy to let mortgage if you’re a first-time buyer. Having said this, there are some lenders who’ll be happy to take a chance on you.
Don’t rush ahead and buy the first property you see. It’s always worth taking into account the local area, the condition of the house and its earning potential. Buy to let pitfalls to avoid It’s also important to look at some of the common buy to let pitfalls that you’ll want to avoid. Many people don’t take the time to learn about owning a buy to let property before jumping in headfirst and this is a very risky strategy.
If you’re planning to become a buy to let landlord, avoid the following pitfalls:
Overpricing the rent
: If you ask for a high rent, your profits will of course be higher. However, this could also make it impossible to find a tenant who’s willing to pay that amount, and each month your property is sitting empty, you’re losing money.
Exceeding your budget
: Once you set a budget for your buy to let, take a little time to break this down. If you plan to get a mortgage for example, you’ll need a deposit and the money to cover the mortgage fees. The property itself may also need work done to make it safe for your tenants and you also need to cover legal issues like safety certificates.
Not budgeting for running costs
: Every landlord needs to pay for certain running costs for their buy to let properties. As such, you need to budget for any ongoing costs, repairs and replacements that are a legal requirement.
Treating the property like it’s your home
: Many first-time landlords want to make the buy to let property as comfortable for their tenants as possible and may overspend on comforts and decorating. It’s important to remember that this property is a business opportunity so try not to get carried away. Finding a qualified professional As a landlord, looking after your tenants should be a top priority. This means you’ll need the services of a range of different tradespeople overtime to deal with everything from plumbing leaks, safety checks and painting/decorating.
You’ll want to hire an expert who’ll be efficient and achieve quality results without breaking the bank. That’s why hiring someone you can trust is essential.

Find property maintenance experts landlords rate  How much does property maintenance cost? As we mentioned previously, maintaining your property is essential to keep tenants happy and safe. What’s more, you’ll need to budget for regular maintenance in your property, so you don’t have any nasty surprises.
Thankfully, property maintenance is generally not too expensive, although the price will be determined by the type of maintenance you require.
For example, the average cost of repainting is £16 per hour and the average cost of fixing a leaking pipe is £102. For more costs and guidance, please see our  property maintenance cost guide.  If your tenants are students, it’s also worth reading our  student house maintenance cost guide. Which tradespeople should you use for the job? This will come down to exactly what type of job your property needs. For example, an electrician should deal with electrical connections, a plumber should deal with pipework and a decorator should deal with painting. If you’re unsure who to hire for a job on your property, just use our  free search engine  to locate the right professional in your area.

What is the UK’s covenant of quiet enjoyment?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/covenant-of-quiet-enjoyment/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Garden, Kitchen, Living Room","What is the UK’s covenant of quiet enjoyment?

In This Blog: Do UK tenants have the right to quiet enjoyment? What is not covered under the quiet enjoyment of a property? What counts as a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment? Where can I get further support? As a landlord it’s in your best interest to have a good business relationship with your tenants. This will make it easier and more pleasant if there are any property issues you need to discuss. Legally you need to tackle any property repairs or maintenance promptly but there are some tenants who’ll feel you’re intruding in their home. This is where the covenant of quiet enjoyment comes in to play.
The UK’s covenant of quiet enjoyment states that the tenant has the right to enjoy their home without interference or interruption. The law is a little murky regarding what exactly this means for landlords, but it doesn’t supersede your rights. You still have the right to access the property for repairs and to assess its condition. Do UK tenants have the right to quiet enjoyment? Yes, by law a tenant should be able to relax and unwind in their home without constantly being disturbed or interrupted. Of course, as a legal requirement, landlords need to keep the property in good, liveable condition and keep up with any repairs. This means they or their representatives will need to access the property for these purposes.
In order to preserve the tenant’s right to quiet enjoyment, the landlord needs to give written notice at least 24 hours before an inspection or maintenance is planned. Any access also needs to be at a reasonable time of day. This gives the tenant time to plan ahead and be prepared to allow access to the property. What is not covered under the quiet enjoyment of a property? The term ‘quiet enjoyment of a property’ is often misunderstood by tenants who believe they’re entitled to a home free of noise. This isn’t the case.
The term was officially defined in 1888 where a judge explained that the word ‘quietly’ in this case means without interruption and interference. Any excess noise from outside the property should be dealt with by the local authorities. What counts as a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment? While the covenant of quiet enjoyment is by no means definitive, it’s essential that landlords are aware of what constitutes harassment. Harassment is considered a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment which can cause legal issues with tenants. Examples of harassment include:
When a landlord drops into the property with no notice.
When a landlord turns up early in the morning or late at night for an inspection.
When a landlord visits frequently without good reason.
When a landlord comes to the property when the tenant is out and without permission.
When a landlord stays longer than is necessary. Where can I get further support? Checkatrade

How to build an alcove cupboard and shelves,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/build-alcove-cupboard-and-shelves/,"Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","How to build an alcove cupboard and shelves

In This Blog: How to build an alcove cupboard and shelves How to build alcove shelves FAQs Alcoves can be awkward spaces inside your house. These tricky recesses that seemingly don’t serve any purpose can be a logistical nightmare for organising furniture. But, rather than writing them off as a waste of space, consider making use of them.
Alcoves can be practical places, and with a little imagination, can work in harmony with your property. Whether there’s a dull alcove in your bedroom, living room, or bathroom, alcoves provide perfect pockets of space for shelving and cupboards, creating a centrepiece in any room.
In this guide, we’ll show you a simple way to build an alcove cupboard and shelving unit to give your home more storage.
Alternatively, you can  hire a local carpenter  your neighbours recommend and find out how much  alcove cupboards cost  in our handy guide. How to build an alcove cupboard and shelves If you’re looking at this, you’ve probably decided to tackle the task yourself. Building an alcove cupboard and shelves unit is a great way to give your living space more storage space.
Tools and materials checklist
MDF wood for the fronts and sides of the cupboard (you can have this trimmed to the desired size by heading to an off-cuts section in any hardware store)
Wood for the frame
Hinges
Handles
Magnetic strips to keep the doors closed
Wood glue
Tack nails
Screws
Safety goggles
Gloves
Biscuit jointer
Step 1: Make the plinth
Work out how many shelves and doors you need and measure the alcove. If possible, we advise making the plinth from redwood timber.
Step 2: Put the plinth into position
Next, you need to put the plinth into position. You’ll need to use packers to level it up then use metal brackets to secure it to the floor.
Step 3: Create the plywood feet
Make plywood feet and screw them at various places around the perimeter of the plinth so that when weight’s applied, the weight will be taken evenly around the plinth unit
When the main unit is positioned on the plinth unit, it’ll stick out by roughly 1cm or 10mm.
Step 4: Cover the plinth
Place an MDF cover over the top of the plinth so it covers all the screw holes. And finally, cut away the skirting board at one corner and leave a gap so you can place 6mm MDF within it
Step 5: Construct the base unit
Take two pieces of MDF and cut them to make the unit’s carcasses. Use a biscuit jointer, screws, and glue to assemble the parts (that’s the side pieces, top rails, and the base piece). You’ll need to use the base jointer for the base and top rails and then again for the two side sections.
Top tip:
 You can use bookcase strips to adjust the height of the shelves in the cabinets.
Step 6: Screw it together
Next, route out the grooves for the metal bookcase strips and then apply the glue, inserting the biscuits into the joints. Drill pilot holes for the screws, then screw it all together.
Top tip: 
To keep the frame square, use clamps to hold the L-shaped brackets. We recommend using biscuit joints to give the unit stability.
Step 7: The finishing touches
Sand the unit down, and then paint to your liking. Place the doors on the cupboard – make sure there’s a one-millimetre gap between the centre of the cupboard and the doors, so the doors don’t stick and can move easily.
Fit the handles onto the doors at the desired height, so they’re functional and aesthetically pleasing. Then paint each surface to complement your room’s colour scheme and to stop the surfaces from spoiling. When building your alcove cupboard and shelves, make sure you protect every surface with sheets.

Find a carpenter your neighbours recommend  How to build alcove shelves Step 1: Measure it right
Measure the alcove then use screws to hold the top and bottom panels in place.
Fit the framework around the wall using 20mm battens, ripped to size, then screw them into the wall.
You can use grab adhesive, depending on the wall type and the anticipated loading of the shelves, especially for hollow walls.
Step 2: Secure into place
Apply the grab adhesive to the top and bottom surfaces of the battens before screwing the shelf panels in place. For example, you can use 18mm MDF on the top and 6mm MDF on the bottom.
You can use plywood for the top surface if you can, but MDF should be fine. Glue and screw in a front-trim fascia then fill in all of the screw holes with a two-part filler. Sand it down and caulk the edges of the shelves for a smart finish -then gloss or prime them.
Don’t trust your DIY skills? Well, you can trust one of our tradespeople. Why not  hire a local carpenter  your neighbours recommend to help you out?

Find a carpenter your neighbours recommend  FAQs How do you shelve an alcove?
Fix three timber battens, one on each wall, for the shelf to rest on.
Using a spirit level, fit the back batten to the wall first.
If the alcove’s too narrow for your spirit level, you can measure down from the ceiling or up from the floor instead.
How high should an alcove cupboard be?
An alcove cupboard should be roughly 80cm high. However, if you’re planning to place a TV on top of the alcove cupboard, you’ll need something a bit lower.
What are alcove units?
Alcove units are made up of a series of cupboards at the case, with shelving above. You can have shelves and cupboards made professionally by a carpenter to give your property more than enough storage.
What’s the cost to build alcove cupboards?
Take a look at our  alcove cupboard cost guide  which reveals all you need to know about how much it’ll cost to build them.

Try to do everything on your own
: Unless you’re a DIY expert you’ll need help with certain parts of your renovation for the best results.
Just pick the cheapest workers
: Hiring cheap workers will help you to stick within your budget but you may not be happy with the finished work quality. It could then cost more to put it right.
Underestimate timings and stress levels
: Always prepare yourself for things to take longer than planned, this is a very common issue that many homeowners aren’t prepared for. It can also be very stressful living in a building zone so make sure you’re expecting upheaval and extra stress during renovations.
Choose furniture that is too large
: Another obstacle homeowners face is ordering furniture. If you want a big squishy sofa, make sure your living room is large enough that the sofa won’t block access and dwarf the space. How to plan home renovations on a budget Whatever your budget you need to make sure your plans are feasible. For example, having a £1,000 budget and expecting to revamp your entire house is unrealistic.
Wondering how to plan home renovations on a budget? Use the following tips:
Ask for multiple quotes
: You don’t need to pick the cheapest quote if it doesn’t meet your goals, but it’ll give you a clearer idea of how much your plans will cost.
Hire a designer
: This does add an extra cost, but they’ll be able to advise you on the best ways to stay within your budget and where you can cut costs.
Pay for a survey
: This can help to show any potential issues and pitfalls in advance that may require more of your budget.
Hone your DIY skills
: Use online guides to help you to learn how to do the easier parts of your renovation yourself. Renovating a house checklist When you’re considering a large-scale renovation, planning is the most important step in the process. That’s why putting together a house renovation checklist is key to a successful project.
So, how do you put together a full checklist? Well, our  house renovation checklist guide  is a brilliant source of information that’ll give you advice and ideas for how to best plan your renovations. It also includes handy sections on the first steps to renovating a home, the proper process to do so and an easy-to-follow step-by-step guide. FAQs In what order should you renovate a house?
Most house renovations cover a variety of different areas like decorating, construction and plumbing. As such it’s essential that you have a proper schedule of works in place. This detailed document should cover the order of your renovations, with information on budgets, workers and timescales. Our  how to renovate a house guide  covers creating a schedule of works in more detail.
Confused or lost? No problem, just check out our  house renovation checklist guide  that looks at the best order for your renovations. So, what are the steps in renovating a house? Most renovations will follow a standard process covering planning, preparation, construction, utilities and finishing touches.
How do I plan a total home renovation?
If you’re unsure how to plan a total home renovation, don’t worry, you’ll learn how to put together a plan using this guide. We’d recommend starting by considering what your budget is and how this will be split to cover each part of your renovation.
Once you have a budget, you can start contacting tradespeople to get quotes for every step of your project. You can then revisit your budget and plan out timescales.
If you’re struggling with planning your home renovation, why not hire a project manager? They can help to guide you through the process, make sure no stone is left unturned and manage the tradespeople working in your home. Remember you can always refer to our  house renovation checklist guide  for further support.
What is the first thing to do when renovating a house?
We’d suggest starting your renovation project by hiring a professional to conduct a survey of your property. A  measured survey  will cover the exact dimensions of your home, a great time saver during renovations.
You’ll also get important information about any unforeseen issues that you’ll need to budget for. We’d then recommend putting together a schedule of works. Finding the best professionals While you can take on various jobs during your renovations yourself, if you need significant construction, electrical or plumbing work, you’ll need to hire at least one tradesperson. So, how do you find the right professionals? You’ll want to hire someone trustworthy and experienced, after all you are trusting this worker inside your home.
The best way to find a range of different, local tradespeople is to use our  online search feature.  Just type in your postcode to get a variety of different contacts, recommended by your neighbours. We thoroughly check all our members who also have profile pages where you can view examples of their work to further reassure you.
For larger projects that require the assistance of several different tradespeople, why not try our  request a quote feature ? Give us the details of your project and we’ll pass your information on to three local professionals. They’ll either get in touch asking for further details or send you a quote, it’s that simple!
If you’re planning to do parts of the renovation yourself, one of the best places to find information online is the  HomeOwners Alliance  website. You’ll find handy guides covering a wide range of different home improvement projects plus tips on picking the right tradespeople. How much does a home renovation cost? This will really come down to the scale of your renovation plans. For example, it’ll be much cheaper to paint the walls inside your home than to convert your loft. If you’re unsure how much to budget for your project, check out our  house renovation cost guide.  There you’ll find a range of different prices and factors to consider. Below are a few examples of the costs included in this guide:
The average cost to replaster your walls: £2,500
The average cost for a new kitchen: £17,500
The average cost for new windows: £4,250 Which tradespeople should you use for the job? Again, this will depend on which parts of your home you plan to renovate. For example, you’ll need an electrician if you’re rewiring your home, a plumber if you intend to add a new bathroom and a painter/decorator for finishing touches.
Remember, you can use our  request a quote feature  to save you the time and energy of finding reliable tradespeople.

How to make a shoe rack in 10 steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/make-shoe-rack/,Kitchen,"How to make a shoe rack in 10 steps

In This Blog: How to make a shoe rack out of wood pallets How to make a shoe rack out of pallets FAQs We’re going to show you how to make a shoe rack and minimise clutter. Why not tidy away your pumps in a lovingly homemade design that’s both eco-friendly and carbon neutral?
Sure, there are ways to  store your shoes , that includes  hiding them under the stairs , but this guide is going to teach you how to make a shoe rack out of wood pallets. It’s worth noting that working with wood, drills and saws requires a basic grasp of DIY techniques. If you’re in any way unsure of your skills, don’t hesitate to hire a professional to build you a bespoke design.
If you’re ready to tackle this project yourself, read on for our top tips and expert guidance. How to make a shoe rack out of wood pallets To make this wood pallet shoe rack, source your pallets or reclaimed wood from a local and trusted supplier.
Tools you’ll need for the job
Before you get started, add the following equipment to your arsenal:
4-5 pallets or reclaimed wood
Drill and drill bit set
Hand and mire saw
Clamps
Set square
Tape measure
Electric sander
Screws
Wood glue How to make a shoe rack out of pallets Step 1: Deconstruct the pallets
Once you’ve sourced your pallets, it’s time to carefully deconstruct them so there are no nails sticking out.
Step 2: Cut the pallets down to size
Measure the pallet’s out and decide on the height and length of the shoe rack you want (e.g. 1m H x 1m L). You should have 4 planks that are the same length for the height and 12 planks that are the same length for the shelves. Next, cut 6 planks roughly the length of your shoes (e.g.12 inches).
Step 3: Arrange the pieces of wood
Take two of the pieces of wood for the height of your shoe rack and stand them horizontally on their sides. Then, take one of the smaller planks and place it at the end horizontally on its side – joining the two larger planks together to create a U. After that, place 3 of the smaller planks flat along the top of the structure, starting from the other end of the U at the bottom to create your shelf supports. Leave around a 20cm gap between each so there’s enough space for your shoes.
Top tip:
 Leave a larger area at the top for boots!
Step 4: Screw the wood together
To stop the wood splitting, drill some pilot holes where you’re going to secure the planks. Add some wood glue for extra security and screw in the screws to keep it all together. Do the same for the smaller top plank at the top of the structure. You should now have a U shape with three planks on one side of the structure.
Step 5: Repeat this process again
Make another U structure, then line it up with your first structure so you can accurately measure where the shelf support planks are, which will help you make sure your shelves are level. Screw it all together like before so you’re left with two identical U shaped structures.
Step 6: Make the shelves
Stand the U structures vertically so the bottom of the U is at the top (like a rainbow). Make sure the ladder planks are facing out so the concave of each structure faces each other. Next, take 3 of the shelf planks of wood and slide them on the top of the bottom shelf support planks on each U structure. Arrange them neatly and line everything up, making sure the middle plank is an equal distance from the outer planks of your shelf.
Step 7: Screw in the shelves
Drill pallet holes like before and screw in the shelves on each rung so you’re left with a sturdy finish.
Step 8: Fill in the top gaps with offcuts
After you’ve secured the three planks at the top of your shoe rack, you’ll see there are two small gaps between the planks at each end. To cover these, get some offcuts of the planks you’ve already cut and measure the distance you need to fill, marking it with a pencil and cutting them to size. Glue these small pieces of wood first and then screw them in.
Step 9: Sand down the shoe rack
Now you’ve made your shoe rack from old pallets, it’s time to sand it all down and prepare it for its final touches. Use a belt sander or industrial hand sander to achieve a smooth and professional finish.
Step 10: Paint your shoe rack
Treat your shoe rack with a pre-wood treatment. Let it dry before going over it with the stain or paint of your choice. Now all that’s left to do is store your shoes and admire your handiwork!

How to build a brick BBQ in 8 steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/build-brick-bbq/,Garden,"How to build a brick BBQ in 8 steps

In This Blog: How to build your brick BBQ in 8 steps Gather these tools needed to make your brick BBQ How to build a brick bbq without cement Hire a professional to build a barbecue Brick barbecue design ideas For barbecue fans, you can’t beat having your own sturdy brick BBQ in the garden. In this guide, we look at how to build a brick BBQ, the tools you’ll need and the steps to take.
By building your own brick built BBQ you can create the perfect size and shape barbecue for you and your home. Keep reading to find out more. How to build your brick BBQ in 8 steps We’ve put together this step-by-step guide to show you how to make a brick BBQ for your home.
The process should take you two days to complete – on the first day you’ll be preparing the brick BBQ area and laying the first set of bricks. Then on the second day you’ll finish laying the bricks and finishing off the mortar work. Gather these tools needed to make your brick BBQ Here are the tools you’ll need to build a brick BBQ:
Bricks
Mortar (builder’s sand and cement)
Bucket
Pencil or chalk
Bricklaying trowel
Spirit level
Lump hammer
Bolster chisel
Tape measure
A piece of metal or rubber tube 20-25mm diameter (for scoring the mortar)
Soft hand brush
Protective gloves
Safety goggles
If you don’t have the tools, then a professional definitely will, so it might be easier to hire a bricklayer instead.

Find recommended bricklayers to build a BBQ 
But if you do have the tools to build the BBQ yourself, then let’s get started…
1. Choose the location for your BBQ
You’ll need to start by deciding where you’re going to build your brick BBQ, which will ideally be a hard, flat surface. Most homeowners choose to build a barbecue on the patio. If, however, you want to build your barbecue on a soft surface (like a lawn) then you’ll need to make a concrete foundation to lay the bricks on.
2. Buy your barbecue grill set
The starting point when building your brick BBQ is to get your grill set – which will contain the grill unit, a charcoal tray and an ashtray. You need your barbecue grill set to determine the size and internal dimensions of your brick BBQ.
3. Calculate the number of materials
Once you know how big your grill set is you can work out how many bricks you’ll need for the BBQ. If you have a grill set of around 700mm x 400mm, you’ll need roughly 100 to 120 standard bricks (215mm x 102.5mm x 65mm) to build a barbecue that’s 10 courses high. Most brick built BBQs are 10 to 12 courses high and will have about 10mm of mortar between each course.
If you opt for non-standard bricks then you’ll need to factor in the dimensions when working out how many bricks you’ll need.
4. Lay out the bricks
Before you start fixing bricks into position, it’s helpful to lay the grill on the ground where you want your barbecue to be and then place the bricks around it to see how the positioning works (remember to leave a 10mm gap between each brick to allow for the mortar).
Once you’re happy with the positioning of the bricks, use a pencil or chalk to draw around the outside of the bricks on the floor to clearly mark where they will be laid. You can now put the bricks and grills to one side.
5. Mix the mortar
You’re going to mix the mortar in two batches – the first on day one for the first 5 courses of bricks, and the second on day two for the remaining five courses of bricks. It’s important to mix the right amount of mortar so that you have enough for the first five courses of bricks, but don’t make too much that you’ll waste it before you have a chance to use it.
You also need to pay close attention to the ratios of sand to cement so that you can repeat the exact same ratios for the second batch so that the mortar is the same consistency and colour across all the courses.
Top tip:
 A good ratio is 4:1, with four parts builder’s sand to one part cement.
6. Lay the first five courses of bricks
Using the marked guidelines you pencilled or chalked on the ground, start by placing enough mortar within the lines to take the first two bricks – be generous with the mortar. Lay your first brick and knock it down to be level, aiming to have a mortar bed of 10mm across all courses.
Take the second brick, spread mortar onto one end and place it up against the first brick you laid and gently tap it into place. Use a spirit level to check that both bricks are suitably lined up. Then repeat this process for the rest of the first course, and keep going until you complete 5 full courses of bricks.
Once you’ve completed the first five courses, leave them to allow for the mortar to harden – this is important so that the base of the brick BBQ can take the weight of all the bricks on top.
Top tip:
 The third brick usually turns the corner to start creating the back wall of the brick BBQ, so you can lay the third brick at a 90-degree angle to the second brick – this helps create a stronger structure for your barbecue.
7. Plan the grill shelves
Before you move on to finishing the last 5 courses of bricks, you’ll need to plan the shelves that will support your grill set. Work out a comfortable height for using the grill and you’ll then need to lay three bricks side pointing inwards on each side to create the shelves.
You’ll need to create three shelves, one for the ashtray, one for the coals tray and then another grill rack. If you’re building a brick BBQ with 10 brick courses, you’d typically create the shelves on courses 6, 8 and 10.
8. Finish off the final five brick courses
With your shelves planned you can now finish off the final five courses of bricks, building in the three shelves. Once done, leave for the mortar to harden. Put your grill set in place and you’re ready to go. Job done.

Find recommended bricklayers to build a BBQ  How to build a brick bbq without cement If you want to make a brick BBQ without cement or mortar, you can create a more simple brick barbecue pit by stacking fireproof bricks or cinder blocks so that they fit together neatly with no mortar needed. The barbecue pit won’t be a robust structure like a bricks and mortar barbecue, but it is a simpler alternative. Hire a professional to build a barbecue If building a brick barbecue doesn’t sound like your thing, or you don’t have the time to dedicate to the job, hire a local tradesperson to do it for you.
As with all home improvement projects, we always recommend obtaining at least three quotes from different tradespeople in your area. You’ll want to shop around to make sure you’re paying a fair and competitive price for the work for your brick barbecue project. And, thankfully, we’ve got a tool that makes finding multiple quotes super easy.
Our  request a quote  feature is perfect for getting multiple quotes. You simply post details about the work you need doing and we’ll send it out to local tradespeople in your area.

How to build a guinea pig run in 6 easy steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/build-guinea-pig-run/,Garden,"How to build a guinea pig run in 6 easy steps

In This Blog: What you’ll need to build a guinea pig run How do you make a homemade guinea pig run? FAQs Expand your beloved pet’s horizons by learning how to build a guinea pig run. Let them explore the great outdoors and fall in love with playing outside using our tips.
Our guide is going to take you through the easiest method for a homemade indoor guinea pig run that you can put outside too. So, read on for our expert guidance.
If you’re looking for a bespoke design, consider  hiring a local carpenter . Use our free search and see who your neighbours recommend for the job. What you’ll need to build a guinea pig run Before you get started on your DIY guinea pig run, you’ll need to gather your supplies.
Tools you’ll need for the job
Materials:
10x furring strips (2 x 2 x 8 inches)
Chicken wire
4x hinges
2x hook and eye locks
24x 3-inch screws
Tools:
Circular or table power saw
Drill and drill bits
Staple gun
Measuring tape
Wire cutters
Safety equipment
Pencil and ruler How do you make a homemade guinea pig run? Step 1: Cut your furring strips to size
To make a rectangle guinea pig run, you need to measure the following:
8x 48-inch long furring strips
12x 24-inch long furring strips
Use your pencil and ruler to mark out the measurements. Then, take your chosen power saw and make the cut as cleanly as possible.
Note:
 handling a power tool is dangerous. If you’re unsure of yourself in any way, please  hire a professional . Alternatively, buy the furring strips pre-cut at the right measurements.
Step 2: Make four rectangles out of the furring strips
Connect 2x 48-inch furring strips to 2x 24inch furring strips to make 4-rectangles. Screw them together at each join with a clamp to keep them steady.
Step 3: Add another furring strip for extra support
Once you’ve made your rectangles, add another 24-inch furring strip horizontally down their centres. Use your measuring tape to make sure you find the centre so they’re all even when lined up.
Step 4: Secure the chicken wire
Once you’re left with your 4-rectangles, it’s time to add your chicken wire. To do this, stretch your chicken wire roll over each rectangle frame lengthwise and pull it taut. Then, cut the chicken wire with your cutters and repeat the process for the other frames. To secure, line up the cut chicken wire to the edge of your frame and staple the top with your staple gun. This lets you pull the rest taut and secure with more staples.
Top tip:
 Space the staples about 5 inches apart to ensure a secure attachment.
(How to make a folding guinea pig run)
Step 5: Attach hinges to connect two frames
Once you have your four completed rectangles, choose two and place them next to each other at a right angle so it creates a corner. Then, add two hinges to the shortest side of both frames, about 2 inches away from the top and bottom of the frame edges. Screw-in using a drill so one side of the hinge is attached to the first frame and the other side of the hinge is attached to the other frame, securing them together.
Repeat 
Step 5
 on the other two hinges so you have two pairs of hinged frames. This lets you open and close your run on two sides.
Step 6: Add hook and eye locks to connect the frames
So you’re able to open and close your run with ease, attach a hook and eye lock to the opposite side of the hinged pairs – a hook on one side and an eye on the other about an inch from the top. Repeat this on the other hinged pair but swap the sides you place the hook and eye so you can secure both frames together.
Now, put the frames together to make a rectangle and, voila! You’ve just made your simple guinea pig run. Now all that’s left to do is test it out on a juicy patch of grass.
Top tip:
 So your guinea pig feels safe and gets the most out of its run, add lots of enrichment and hiding places so it can easily hide from the elements.

Find carpenters your neighbours recommend  FAQs How do I fox-proof my run?
If you want a fox-proof guinea pig run, the best way to do this is to create one that doesn’t move. Foxes are cunning and will find ways into your run if it’s not secured properly. Chicken wire and a roof help. However, you’ll also need to make sure they can’t dig under the run, which is why burying it or plumbing it with concrete first is recommended.
How long should guinea pigs be in a run?
To give your guinea pig the maximum outdoor benefit, let them play for no more than 4 hours. Just remember to add a water bottle to the cage and a bowl of food so they don’t go without sustenance while they’re running around.
Can a guinea pig run around in a ball?
Balls aren’t recommended for guinea pigs as they often die of heat exhaustion. Therefore, we recommend building them a run to get their quota of exercise instead.
What should I put on the floor of my guinea pig run?
If you don’t have a nice patch of grass for them to graze on, we recommend adding recycled paper bedding, fleece bedding or hay. This gives them a respite from the hard floor as they run around.
Do guinea pigs need a run?
Whether you attach one to their hutch or build them a DIY option, giving your guinea pigs the option to run around is kind and responsible pet ownership.
Should I hire a professional?
If you’re thinking of attempting any DIY work, we ask you to think about the risks associated with bad workmanship – not to mention the extra costs involved when it comes to correcting any mistakes. If you’re in any doubt about taking on a task, we highly recommend  hiring a local expert  your neighbours know and trust.
When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews. Even better, those reviews are from your neighbours and checked by us to make sure they’re legitimate. Not only that, but if you book one of our members for the job, we  guarantee their work,  which gives you the extra peace of mind and security that you and your project is in safe hands.

How to make a wine rack in 7 simple steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/make-a-wine-rack/,Kitchen,"How to make a wine rack in 7 simple steps

In This Blog: How to make a wooden wine rack in 7 simple steps How to make a wine rack lattice FAQs Should I hire a professional? Prop up your corks in style with our how to make a wine rack guide. We’re going to take you through the best and easiest way to complete this DIY project.
Before we get started, it’s worth noting that you’ll need some basic woodworking skills to complete this project. Although the design we’re showing you is simple and stylish, accuracy and patience are required to get this right.
If you’re in any way unsure about doing the project yourself, why not  hire a professional  your neighbours know and recommend to build a bespoke wine rack for you? How to make a wooden wine rack in 7 simple steps So, how do you make a simple wine rack?
First, you work out how many bottles of wine you want to house. We’re going to show you how to make a wooden wine rack that holds 13 bottles. You can adapt this design to make it longer or taller if required – no judgement here!
Tools you’ll need for the job
Here’s what you’ll need before you get started.
Pencil and ruler
Tape measure
Circular saw
Chosen wood from your local hardware store
Drill and wood drill bit
Wood primer and stain
Sander How to make a wine rack lattice Step 1: Measure your centre sections
For the centre sections of your wine rack, mark out 12 inches by 8 inches and cut with a straight edge using a circular saw. Repeat 8 times until you have 8 same-sized rectangle pieces.
Step 2: Measure your end sections
To make the end pieces, mark out 8 inches by 8 inches and cut using a circular saw. Repeat twice so you have 2 same-sized pieces.
Step 3: Mark the slot sections
As we’re teaching you how to make a criss-cross wine rack, this part is about marking the areas the wood is going to slot together to make the lattice effect.
So, take a centre plank, find its horizontal centre and mark with a pencil. From that centre line, measure to each end of the plank and find the centre of that half. Mark with a pencil. You should be left with three marks that divide the plank into thirds.
The outer marks are where your slots are going to go. From those lines, measure a straight line 6 inches along the width of the plank and mark with a pencil. From that line, measure ½ a cm on either side towards the midline and mark again. Draw a straight line back up the plank so you now have two thin rectangle slot shapes on the plank that are ½ cm wide.
Repeat this for the other 7 planks.
Top tip:
 Use tracing paper and cut out a paper template to save yourself some time.
Step 4: Cut out the slot sections
Once this is done, it’s time to cut out the slot sections with your circular saw. The best way to do this is to drill a hole at the end of each slot. This lets your circular saw run along the edges so the section pops out in one clean movement.
Once the sections are all cut, sand them down until they’re smooth. Use a rasp if necessary.
Step 5: Test fit the sections
Once all your pieces of wood are ready, test fit them by slotting them together at a right angle. The fit should be perfect. If not, you might need to sand down the slots a little more.
To create the finished result, take the end pieces and fit those to the first lattice to create your base. Then, add the other centre sections in a criss-cross until you get to the last piece. Fit the other end piece to create the base on the opposite end.
You should now have 7 diamond shapes and 13 places to store wine bottles.
Step 6: Apply the pre-stain and finish
Now you know the pieces all fit, dismantle the design and use some pre-stain to paint the wood. Let it dry before using your chosen finish.
Step 7: Reassemble the design and enjoy
Once the pieces are dry, reassemble the design. If there are any wobbly bits, use some wood glue to create a sturdier fit. Otherwise, place your wine bottles on your latticework and bask in the glory of a job well done!

Hire the cabinet maker your neighbours recommend  FAQs What can I use instead of a wine rack?
There are various objects that double up as a wine rack, such as towel organisers, shoe holders, shelving units and even storage racks. We recommend making sure you store any wine as horizontal as possible, as this stops air from entering through the cork, keeping the wine at its finest.
What is the best wood to make a wine rack out of?
If you’re keeping your wine in a cellar, redwood, cedar and mahogany are industry preferred woods. However, for your DIY project, any reclaimed hardwood from your local hardware store is recommended for both environmental and eco-friendly credentials.
How do you make a wine rack for beginners?
If you aren’t confident in your DIY abilities, start small by repurposing old items such as cabinets, storage units and shoe racks. If you’re more confident, use this how to make a wine rack guide to fashion a diamond-shaped design. Should I hire a professional? If you’re thinking of attempting any DIY work, we ask you to think about the risks associated with bad repairs – not to mention the extra costs involved when it comes to correcting any mistakes. If you’re in any doubt about taking on a task, we highly recommend  hiring a local expert  your neighbours know and trust.
When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews.

Which Checkatrade member could make me a wine rack?
We recommend a carpenter for the job – they will have the hands-on skill and experience to create a bespoke wooden wine rack.
If you’re wondering what a wine rack might cost to create, then check out our  carpentry cost guide  for some guidance. The best way however to get a good cost idea is to request quotes from at least three carpenters in your local area.

How to design a kitchen in 4 steps – including 18 top tips,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/design-kitchen/,Kitchen,"How to design a kitchen in 4 steps – including 18 top tips

In This Blog: How to design a kitchen in 4 steps 10 top tips for how to design a kitchen layout How much does it cost to design a kitchen? 8 tips for how to design a small kitchen How to get a quote for a kitchen designer FAQs The kitchen is often described as the heart of the home and if you’re planning a new kitchen, you want to make sure your new kitchen is perfect for you and your home. In this guide, we look at how to design a kitchen with a step-by-step guide and our top tips for designing a kitchen.
With planning and some creativity, you can design a kitchen that is both functional and stylish for you to enjoy time in – whether that’s cooking, cleaning, eating or entertaining. Keep reading to find out more about how to design your own kitchen. How to design a kitchen in 4 steps If you’re wondering how to plan a kitchen design, here are the four steps to help you get there…
1. Plan your budget
Many of your decisions throughout the kitchen design process will be influenced by your budget, so you’ll need to know how much you have to spend from the very beginning. Having a clear idea of your finances will then help you keep your spending on track.
2. Write a wish list
Before you start planning what goes where, make a list of all the features and appliances that you want to include in your kitchen. Think about what you currently have in your existing kitchen and what you want and/or need in your new kitchen. It’s useful to do this planning before you speak to a kitchen designer, so that you can give them your wish list to work with.
If you end up with a long list, try and prioritise the items so that you know which ones are the most important – in case some need to get culled because of budget restraints.
3. Make a mood board
Once you have a list of what you want to fit into your new kitchen design, it’s time to gather your ideas for the look and feel of the kitchen. When you’re looking to design your own kitchen, the style you choose is completely down to your personal taste. Creating a mood board helps you figure out exactly what style you’re going for – whether you do it perusing Pinterest or ripping out inspiration from interior design magazines.
You might even want to get samples from kitchen suppliers, such as tiles, fabric swatches and paint testers. Don’t worry too much about budget when you’re creating your mood board – you can adjust your final choices of materials and suppliers once you know exactly what you’re trying to achieve.
4. Hire a professional kitchen designer
If you want to design a kitchen that makes the most of every inch of the space, achieves all the functionality and features that you need, and looks great, a professional kitchen designer is the answer. Experienced kitchen designers are skilled in working with kitchens of all sizes, styles and budgets.
A kitchen designer will have the latest knowledge of kitchen products, appliances, fixtures and fittings. And they also often have a whole host of clever tricks to maximise space and storage that will help them design a kitchen that you’ll love.
For the best kitchen design, we always recommend that you work with an experienced kitchen designer. You can find designers that your neighbours recommend easily here at Checkatrade.

Find an experienced local kitchen designer  10 top tips for how to design a kitchen layout When it comes to the detail of designing a kitchen and how to design a kitchen layout, here are our 10 tips to help you create a kitchen that you’ll love for years.
Research different kitchen layouts
 to find the one that works best for your kitchen space
Plan enough space to move around
 so that it’s easy to access all the cabinets and appliances – a decent walkway in kitchen should be at least 36-48 inches wide
Create a focal point
 to give your kitchen a central point that attracts the eye, like a bold backsplash or dramatic flooring pattern
Account for doors opening
 so that you don’t end up with cabinet or appliance doors knocking each other
Create plenty of counter space
 to allow you (or the chefs in your house) to prepare meals, and ideally locate them near the key appliances – such as the cooker and refrigerator
Make recycling easy
 by allowing space for multi-unit recycling containers
Provide plenty of plug sockets
 to be able to use multiple countertop appliances, such as a kettle, toast, blender and coffee machine
Choose a paint colour to suit the room
 – if you want bright cabinets or a feature floor, a pale paint such as white, grey or cream will provide the perfect subtle backdrop
Buy the best worktop you can afford
 as your worktop is the most used element in the kitchen and you want it to stand the test of time
Design a lighting scheme
 that includes ambient, task and accent lighting to bring your kitchen to life day and night
Looking for kitchen inspiration? You’re in luck. We’ve put together some of our favourite  kitchen ideas  for you.

Find an experienced local kitchen designer  How much does it cost to design a kitchen? The average  cost of designing a kitchen  will depend on the size, quality and complexity of the kitchen you plan to install. Most kitchen suppliers will offer a free service to help you design your own kitchen, but you’ll be limited to having to use their products and suppliers. If you want an impartial kitchen design service to make the most of your kitchen design, a professional kitchen designer is the way to go.
The  cost of a new kitchen  is somewhere in the region of £5,000 – £14,000. Kitchen designers will either charge a cost per hour or as a percentage of the total cost of the kitchen.
The typical cost of a kitchen designer can range from 
£50 to £150 per hour
, similar to the  cost of an interior designer . Or, for bigger projects, the fee will be around 
8-12% of the total cost
 of the kitchen. ​ 8 tips for how to design a small kitchen For homes with a small kitchen space, there are some smart ways you can make the most of the limited space you have:
Use light colours in small kitchens to enhance the feeling of space
Make the most of windows and natural light sources to flood the room with as much light as possible
Save space with a sliding door, if you can
Consider foldable furniture (tables and chairs) to maximise the usable space
Keep your colour scheme simple with as much consistent use of colour to create the illusion of a bigger kitchen space
Keep your worktops as clear as possible and try storing appliances in a cupboard when not being used
Use clever corner storage units to utilise awkward corner spaces
Design a kitchen with long, clean lines where possible to visually elongate the room How to get a quote for a kitchen designer As with all home improvement projects, we always recommend getting at least three quotes from different kitchen designers in your area. You’ll want to shop around to make sure you’re paying a fair and competitive price for the work.
Thankfully, our  request a quote  feature is perfect for multiple getting quotes – you simply post details about the work you need doing and we’ll send it out to local tradespeople in your area.  Try it out – it’s quick and easy! Why hire someone from Checkatrade?

No, not really. A project to build your own kitchen can be a complex job involving electrics, gas, water and joinery.
It’s a job best left to the professionals. At the very least you need to hire a plumber, Gas Safe engineer and qualified electrician to carry out work on the plumbing, gas and electrical elements of the kitchen. You can then build the cabinetry around them.

How to adjust a multipoint door lock,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/adjust-multipoint-door-lock/,"Conservatory, Kitchen, Living Room","How to adjust a multipoint door lock

In This Blog: What is a multipoint door lock? How a multipoint door lock works Main reasons why a multipoint door lock doesn’t work Useful door lock checks How to adjust a multipoint door lock FAQs Is your multipoint lock jammed, sticking, or slightly loose? Whether your door hasn’t been fitted accurately or deterioration has caused problems with it, get your uPVC door lock adjusted now before the fault leaves you locked in or locked out of your home.
In this guide, we’ll look at ways to adjust your door lock. But we strongly advise you to take the utmost care when adjusting your uPVC door lock. Sure, our guide may help resolve the issue you’re encountering, but you should only view it as a guide rather than a complete resolution.
Call an expert  double glazing installer  or  locksmith  to have the repair job done as it should be.
If you choose to carry out the repairs yourself, you risk making things worse, especially if you aren’t sure of what you’re doing. Using your local locksmith service can involve a few simple tweaks to rectify the issue.

Hire your local locksmith expert  What is a multipoint door lock? Multipoint locking systems are available in a variety of designs and styles. However, the features of the locks are similar:
They both have a live bolt and a deadbolt
They both feature numerous compression bolts and hook bolts
You’ll need to lift the handle of a multipoint locking system to lock the door correctly, then turn the key. When you’ve locked the door, your property will be extremely safe and secure – it’s an unbeatable way to protect your home from burglars. How a multipoint door lock works Mainly used on composite doors and uPVC doors, a multipoint locking system features three locking points, with rollers or hooks at the top and bottom of the door. It also features a latch in the centre.
You’ll find a multipoint locking system inside the door – it’s on the edges of the door beside a metal strip that spans its entire length.
It functions by using the key or door handle, but sometimes, you can use both the key and handle to lock the system. Inside a gearbox sits the lock itself, which can be replaced separately from the multipoint locking system. Main reasons why a multipoint door lock doesn’t work The lock may not be working due to a mechanical fault. For example, the door could be misaligned with the frame, or the lock is broken. While a locksmith can sort this, it’s better to contact a double glazing expert.
There are a few reasons why your multipoint door lock doesn’t work, which we’ll look at below.
Misalignment
Misalignment decreases the effectiveness of the locking system. If a door is misaligned, the door frame and door aren’t in the correct position. Usually, this happens to older doors and hinges that have started to erode.
Drooping handles
If drooping handles are at the root of the problem, this isn’t great news. If your door has a multipoint locking system, this may mean the system has been used too harshly. Additionally, it can signify the cam has become damaged and may mean replacement multipoint door locks are required.
Drooping handles occur over time until the lock suddenly ceases working.
Difficulty turning the key
If you find that your key simply won’t turn or the key is stuck in the mechanism, this is an indication that the entire locking system may have failed. Take care not to force the key when removing as you may jam the lock tight without actually physically locking the door. If you find this situation we recommend immediately calling an expert in, we recommend a  locksmith  in this scenario.

Hire your local locksmith expert  Useful door lock checks Here are some checks you can carry out yourself:
Check the mitres in each door frame align accurately with the mitres in the door corners
Use a spirit level to check the door isn’t misaligned with the frame
Crack the door open a little – there should be a space between the lock part of the door and the frame (which runs the entire way down)
The above cases could point to a locking problem. In other words, your door may be out of alignment with the frame. How to adjust a multipoint door lock Adjusting multipoint door locks involves the professionalism of an expert, but there are a couple of things you can try yourself.
When you lift the handle on a multipoint lock, you’ll notice a series of hooks and rollers that move the mechanism to secure the door – you can hear and feel metal-on-metal which is where the resistance should be coming from. If the door is sticking or not locking correctly, it’s usually an alignment issue. You may need to adjust the door in or outwards on its hinges to get a good fit.
If you suspect the issue with your door lock is its alignment, it’s best to reach out to a knowledgeable locksmith in your local area. But if you’d like to have a go yourself, here are some straightforward checks you can do yourself.
Tools:
An Allen key
A flat-head screwdriver
A screwdriver
How to fix an alignment issue
Remove the plastic covering the main section of the hinge using a screwdriver (this should run parallel to the bottom of your door.
The distance from the top to the bottom of the door should be the same.
If not, you’ll need to  adjust the hinges .
Place the Allen key in the hole (located in the main section of the hinge).
Make half a turn – the door should start pulling back towards the hinge side.
Recheck the handle.
Repeat this on the centre hinge, checking your uPVC door is shutting and locking following each adjustment.
Rotate the key (do the same number of turns as before) until the door aligns with the door frame.
Then move onto the bottom one and repeat – half a turn.
Check the handle again.
You should find the resistance eases.
Door lock tip:
 Extend the life of your uPVC door lock and reduce deterioration by simply greasing it a minimum of once a year.
Another problem can be that the distance is the same, top to bottom. If you’re still struggling with the door, it suggests the door itself has dropped.
This is common with heavily glazed doors, where the door’s weight has been pushing down over the years. In which case, you may need to remove the beads and repack the door.
This is a service you’ll have to employ an expert to do. If you continue to lift the handle, you’ll eventually break the mechanism, which can be expensive – so it’s best to get a locksmith your neighbours recommend to come out,  which costs from £150. Similarly, if you have a door but can’t actuate the mechanism at all or it’s still in a locked position, and you can’t get it open, we recommend recruiting the help of a pro. FAQs How do you realign a uPVC door lock?
You’ll need to check one of the corners to ensure the door and doorframe miter joints are aligned correctly. Use a spirit level on top of the door and check if any gaps are obvious between the frame and door. For more detailed checks you can carry out if you suspect your uPVC door lock is misaligned, see the ‘how to adjust multipoint door lock’ section above.
Takeaways
Refrain from forcefully closing or locking the door, as this will cause further harm and make repairs more difficult, not to mention more expensive.
Ensure you tweak every uPVC door hinge. Else they’ll continue not closing or locking correctly.
If you experience any lock mechanism problems, we advise leaving the door lock or

 task to an expert so you don’t create a more serious issue.

10 tips on how to build decking steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/build-decking-steps/,Garden,"10 tips on how to build decking steps

In This Blog: 5 key considerations on how to build decking steps in the UK A step-by-step guide on how to build decking steps to a raised deck FAQs So, you’ve had your  beautiful new decking  laid. Great! If you haven’t already, you’ll need some decking steps to accompany it, as they’re one of the most integral parts of any structure.
Building decking steps isn’t the easiest of tasks, but it’s not impossible to do yourself. If you’re in doubt, we recommend reaching out to an experienced carpenter or builder to complete the task correctly.
Below, we’ll show you how to estimate step dimensions, layout, cut stair stringers, and put together the stair parts. 5 key considerations on how to build decking steps in the UK If you don’t have ground-level decking, you’ll need to build decking steps to give easy access to your garden. Decking steps also link different levels of the deck together.
You can purchase pre-made kits to build decking steps that typically consist of step treads and two stair risers (known as side panels). You can buy these in three, four, and six-step options.
If you like, you could construct your own using two side panels (risers) and as many individual step treads as you like.
Although, we advise having your decking steps made professionally by your local carpenter.
Step 1: Inspect the site
Make sure the location for your steps is firm and level. The site shouldn’t be too soft or rough, as this won’t be secure enough for the steps – they may sink into the soft earth.
If there isn’t any hard landscaping in your proposed site, think about laying an area of paving slabs or concrete.
Step 2: Cut your steps to size
Cut off two sections of joist off-cut so that they’re the same width as the step treads. Screw them to the step risers at the bottom and top – you can use two countersunk coach screws on either side.
Step 3: Assemble the parts
Place the assembled steps against the deck’s sub-frame and in the middle of the step support pad. The short edge of the stair riser should be against the deck, while the longest should be on the paving slab.
Use a drill to make pilot holes through the step construction and the sub-frame joist. Affix the step construction securely to the sub-frame using four additional countersunk coach screws.
Step 4: Attach the supports
To make a durable step, drill pilot holes, then use two 50mm deck screws to attach the treads into the riser supports at either edge.
Step 5: The finishing touches
For a more solid stairway to an open stair, you can use deck boards or joist off-cuts to fill the gaps. Just measure the depth and height of the gap, and then screw the timber into the step riser using two screws at each edge.
If you’re unsure if this job is in your DIY capabilities, then it’s always best to play it safe and hire a professional. Search our Checkatrade members and see who your neighbours recommend for the job.

Find decking step builders your neighbours rate  A step-by-step guide on how to build decking steps to a raised deck To complement your  raised decking area , you’ll need to create an attractive entrance to it. Follow our guide on how to build raised decking with steps.
Top tip: 
This is a somewhat intricate, lengthy process, so it’s best to read ahead to make sure you understand all the steps before continuing with the project. If you’re unsure how to progress, use our  free search feature  to find a local decking step installer to help you with your project.
Tools you’ll need:
Countersunk coach screws
Chalk line
Corded drill
Circular saw
Clamps
Framing square
Hammer
Safety glasses
Handsaw
Stair gauge
Level
Sawhorses
Materials you’ll need:
Joist off-cut
Step treads
Stair risers
If you don’t have all of this, then it might be easier to hire a professional instead.

Find decking step builders your neighbours rate 
Step 1: Measure the deck stair rise
Measure the height of the stairs from the top of the deck to the landing. The landing should be level ground, a concrete pad, or a deck platform.
Step 2: Install inside or outside mounted stair stringers
There are two different stringer styles – inside mount stringers and outside mount stringers.
For inside mount stringers, remove the thickness of the outside joist from the inside of the top rise.
For outside mount stringers, remove the thickness of the riser board off the back of the stringer. Both situations remove the thickness of the tread from the bottom of the stringer.
Step 3: Lay your first stringer
Lay your stringer on a 2×12 cleat with a framing square, then cut it out using a circular saw. You can use your first cut stringer as a template to trace the remaining stringers.
Step 4: Attach the stringers to the deck frame
You can use two methods to do this.
You can attach the stringers to the interior of the deck frame. Just space your last joist flush with the top riser. Next, attach blocking and nail the top of your stringer into the blocking.
You can also attach your stringers to the outside of the frame – just install a two-by-material cleat to the bottom of the frame to extend the attachment surface. Then attach using angle brackets.
Top tip:
 Stringer spacing should be 12 inches to 25 inches on the centre.
Step 5: Attach the decking over the stringers
This should consist of two decking courses for each tread and one course for each riser. Allow for a half-inch to one-inch tread nosing to project over the riser boards.
Confirm all building code requirements with your local building authority. FAQs How do I build steps for my decking area?
Your step tread width – this is the width of the steps – should be roughly 900mm but no less than 760mm. If your stairs are wider than 900mm, you’ll need to add a central step riser to support the steps and stop them from collapsing.
If you’re constructing your own riser, the vertical distance between each step (step depth) should be between 150-180mm. This is to make sure the steps are a good depth, but not so cavernous that they’re too high to climb, and not so shallow that you’ll stumble on them.
The above applies particularly to the bottom step – this sits between the first riser and the step’s foundation (support pad).
How do I build steps with composite decking?
If you’re thinking of building steps using composite decking, it’s vital to plan the decking step carefully. So, make sure the decking steps are uniform – we’d advise getting in touch with your local carpenter to build decking steps, as it requires a lot of professionalism to guarantee precision and consistency.
What’s more, building steps with composite decking involves measuring the size of the decking stairs as well as knowing how high the deck is.
If your decking’s raised, then you’ll need high decking steps. If it’s low, then you’ll need low decking steps.

Over 30 tips for how to childproof your home,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/childproof-your-home/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Over 30 tips for how to childproof your home

In This Blog: Best UK baby proofing products Best UK child safety locks Best UK corner protectors for babies FAQs Going the extra mile to protect your child How much does it cost to baby proof a home? Which tradespeople should you use for the job? Bringing home a newborn child is incredibly exciting but can be stressful when you consider all the hazards in your home. Thankfully, you can eliminate these worries by childproofing before your little one starts to crawl and move around the house.
Have you ever wondered how to childproof your home? Well, this is the ultimate guide to protecting your baby at home. Today we’ll be covering some of the best babyproofing products in the UK, as well as some of the dangers in your property and how to keep your baby safe.
First, let’s look at the main threats in your home that need to be tackled before your child starts exploring. Below are a few of the ways to childproof your home:
Corners:
 Tables and cabinets will often have sharp, pointed corners that could injure your baby. Use rubber bumpers to prevent injuries.
Drawers and cupboards
: Your child will love opening and closing any drawers or cupboards they can reach. This may mean they come into contact with harmful substances and objects. Add safety catches to drawers and cupboards to stop your baby from accessing these.
Electrical objects
: Any electrical items in your home like hairdryers, irons, DVD players and floor lamps can be dangerous to a small child. So, move these out of reach and keep them unplugged between uses.
Cots:
 Always ensure that your baby’s cot is not in a position that’ll allow them to reach shelves, windows, radiators, lighting, and cords to prevent any accidents. Also, check the cot is sturdy and in good condition before you use it.
Rugs:
 Rugs can be slippery, especially on hard floors, which can cause your toddler to fall over. Adding non-slip patches under your rugs can eliminate this issue.
Power socket:
 You can purchase safety plugs to prevent your baby from sticking their fingers in sockets.
Furniture:
 Any piece of furniture that isn’t heavy can be pulled over by an adventurous baby. The best way to stop your furniture from toppling onto your tot is to attach it to the wall.
Blind cords:
 Any blinds in your home that have dangling cords could pose a threat to babies, so tuck these away.
Ornaments:
 Move any ornaments or breakable objects from your toddler’s reach.
Safety gates:
 You can stop your child from reaching the staircase and the kitchen by using safety gates.

Find a trusted local babyproofer  Best UK baby proofing products There are a range of different products you can purchase to safeguard your baby in your home. Some of the best baby proofing products in the UK include:
Stair gates
: To stop your child from climbing the stairs and falling down.
Bath thermometers
: To ensure that your baby’s bath is at a safe and comfortable temperature.
Cupboard and drawer locks
: To stop your child from opening cupboards with dangerous contents. You can even buy magnetic versions to make it easier for you to access them.
Wall anchors
: To attach your furniture to the wall so it can’t fall over.
Toilet lock
: To prevent little fingers from getting squashed under your heavy toilet seat.
Corner bumpers
: To cover sharp furniture corners.
Fireguard
: To stop your tot getting too close to your fire.
Door locks
: To keep doors to off-limit rooms closed while also preventing them from slamming onto your child’s fingers. Best UK child safety locks Childproof safety locks are designed to protect your baby’s fingers from cabinet and cupboard doors. They also ensure your little one can’t access the cupboard’s contents. This is especially important if you have dangerous chemicals or sharp items in the cabinet. Figuring out what is the best child safety lock for you will depend on your requirements.
You can choose between external and internal safety locks. External locks are fitted to the outside of your cupboards, either through the handles or at the door opening. They work best if you have two doors side by side that you can lock together.
Internal safety locks are fitted inside your cupboards and use either strong magnets, adhesive or screws. Internal locks are also more subtle and won’t affect the appearance of your cabinets. Please note, if you buy a safety lock that uses a magnetic key, there is always a chance your child could get hold of it and open the door themselves. Best UK corner protectors for babies Corner protectors or bumpers are an essential part of childproofing your home. So, you’re probably wondering what the best corner protectors for babies in the UK are? Well, firstly, you should ensure the protectors you choose are non-toxic- because babies love to put everything they find in their mouths.
Another thing to consider is appearance. It’s worth doing a little research to find the corner protectors that work well with your interior design scheme. One of the best options available is the CalMyotis corner protectors, and these can be purchased from many online retailers. A full list of recommended corner protectors can be found on the  Best Reviews Guide website. FAQs Do I need to baby proof my house?
Unfortunately, many children are seriously injured every year in accidents that could have been prevented in the home. While it may be time-consuming and certainly won’t be free, you can help keep your toddler safe by babyproofing your home as soon as possible.
How do I toddler proof my house room by room?
Below we have summarised a few of the ways to toddler proof the different rooms in your home:
Kitchen: 
Adding cupboard safety locks, never leaving your child unattended around hot ovens (remember toddlers can reach your hob, so ensure you don’t leave any pans hanging over the edge) and keeping sharp objects out of the way.
Living room:
 Anchor furniture to the walls, avoid using candles and matches, and install corner protectors.
Bedroom:
 Use safety plugs in your outlets, ensure there is nothing dangerous within reach of your child’s bed, and use non-toxic paint.
Bathroom:
 Install a toilet lock, don’t leave razors or scissors within reach, and don’t leave full baths unattended.
What are five appropriate ways to childproof a house?
The five most important and appropriate ways to childproof a house are in our opinion:
Using safety corner protectors
Blocking any power outlets
Restricting access to the kitchen and staircase
Tucking away any loose cords or wires
Using cabinet door locks Going the extra mile to protect your child Of course, the safety and security of your baby is the most important thing to consider when it comes to childproofing your home.

How to start an asbestos removal company,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-start-an-asbestos-removal-company/,Tag Not Found,"How to start an asbestos removal company

Asbestos was once a common building material until it became clear how dangerous it was to people’s health. Nowadays, removal is in high demand as it’s often found in many older buildings – the most dangerous types were banned in 1985 and then completely outlawed in 1999. As such, there’s plenty of opportunity out there for trained tradespeople like you to capitalise on demand and start up a business in the sector.
Being your own boss means you can take control of how and when you work, plus you’ll be able to choose who you work with. But best of all, you’ll have the chance to grow a thriving business and develop close working relationships with your clients. Sound good but not sure where to start? Don’t worry, this guide will take you through how to start an asbestos removal service so you can take the next step in your career and make the most of the opportunities out there.
Do I need qualifications to start an asbestos removal company?
Asbestos removal is a dangerous line of work, so you’ll need to have the right credentials in place if you want to be seen as a safe and reliable business. Having either of the following qualifications will show potential customers you have the right skills, knowledge and understanding of best practice.
Specialist training course approved by the UK Asbestos Training Association (UKATA)
Asbestos removal operative apprenticeship
Along with qualifications, you’ll also need to apply for an asbestos removal licence issued by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). This is essential because of the dangers involved when handling and disposing of hazardous materials. The process is relatively straightforward and involves a formal assessment visit from a qualified professional. Once you’ve paid for the licence and been given the green light, you can begin looking for work without having to worry about any more paperwork. Just bear in mind that you do need to renew the licence four months before it expires.
What asbestos removal equipment do I need to get started? 
You’re going to need a full inventory of tools for asbestos removal. This is crucial for providing a professional service but also for ensuring you approach the job as safely as possible — you don’t want to make a sloppy mistake in this line of work as it could cause serious harm. Here’s are the essential asbestos removal tools:
Cloth tape
Scraper blades
Polythene bags
Correx sheets
Respiratory mask and gloves
Thick protective clothing
Adhesive and sealant
Power tools
Given the health hazards in this line of work, make sure you invest in high-quality PPE including protective overalls and gloves, as well as respiratory masks. You need to keep yourself safe but also ensure customers are not exposed to dust, so consider how to limit fragments and debris that fall during removal. For more advice on purchasing PPE, read our handy guide  here .
What skills are important for starting an asbestos removal company?
Going self-employed means you’ll face challenges not just on the job, but also running your business. That’s why you’ll need a wide set of skills to overcome these scenarios and succeed. Here are the most important qualities:
Health and safety knowledge is vital for protecting yourself and the client from exposure
You’ll need to pay close attention to detail for spotting material and managing precise removal without errors
Teamwork skills are necessary to work safely with your employees
Basic maths skills are required for managing your finances
It’s important to have some degree of building and construction knowledge for navigating different areas such as attics and guttering
Interpersonal skills are valuable for providing a high standard of customer service and building client relationships
How can I make my skills stand out? 
You can make yourself stand out from the competition by joining a trade association, as this will highlight your industry skills and adherence to the highest standards. Becoming a member of the Asbestos Removal Contractors Association (ARCA), for instance, will enhance your reputation and potentially attract more clients to hire your service.
How do I set up an asbestos removal company? 
Setting up a company takes several steps that you should follow closely if you want to lay solid foundations.
Registration 
First of all, you’ll need to register your business with HMRC and set up as a limited company. The good thing about choosing this structure is it tends to work best for taking on employees and building your team of operatives. But, keep in mind that setting up a limited company takes quite a bit of admin, so you could always choose to operate as a sole trader if you want the more straightforward route. Just remember that as a sole trader you’re personally responsible for any debt or loss your business incurs. For more information on the differences between these structures, read our article  here .
Planning 
Every business needs a thorough plan that sets out different services and who the target market will be. This way, you can approach your new venture with a clear direction. When outlining your service, you should try to find ways to make it unique so you can stand out from the competition. For example, you could build your business around flexibility and offer 24-hour emergency callouts for removal. This is a great way to pick up extra opportunities. Other specialisms could include:
Large-scale phased removal on older estates
Removal in listed buildings that require careful extraction
Removal, demolition and clean-up of condemned buildings
Asbestos search, inspection and consultation
Removal in commercial buildings
Next, you should identify your target audience. It’s best to base this around your expertise. If your experience lies in the domestic market, it makes sense to target homeowners. You could also approach local councils to determine if they have preferred contractors for asbestos removal – this will help you break into different markets with potentially larger, more lucrative contracts.
Pricing 
Your rates will need to take into account local competitors. You don’t want to set your prices too high and have potential customers choosing to go elsewhere, but you also don’t want to set your prices too low and be struggling to make a profit. Licenced asbestos removal is a technical job that requires care and attention, and your pricing should always reflect that. If you’re still unsure, check out our cost guide  here  for a general idea of what to charge.
Insurance 
Hazardous work like this means insurance is absolutely essential. Here are the main types you should purchase: Public liability insurance  – This will protect you if a customer feels their property has been damaged by your work, important if you’re working on historic buildings Professional indemnity insurance  – In the event a customer is left unsatisfied with your work, you’ll be covered against any compensation or legal fees
Employers’ liability insurance – This is a legal requirement for covering your employees. Asbestos removal is dangerous work and sometimes involves working at height so this one is key
Directors’ insurance – As head of the company this will provide you with protection against most claims
How do I grow an asbestos removal company?
Hiring 
As your company grows, you’ll probably be faced with larger workloads and more complex projects. Taking on employees will be essential if you want to tackle all of these jobs safely and efficiently.
That said, hiring is a process you need to treat carefully. Take your time to really make sure the person you’re looking to hire has a proven track record with all the necessary skills and experience. As a part of this, you should check they also have a HSE licence so you can stay on the right side of the law.  Alternatively, you could hire an apprentice as an extra pair of hands. Not only would this be cheaper, but also a great chance to pass on all your skills and knowledge.
Marketing 
Digital marketing is a sure-fire way to develop your reputation and grow your business.  Signing up to Checkatrade  will give your online profile a huge boost, as it opens up your business to over three million monthly site users. Becoming a member also allows you to build your reputation by displaying customer recommendations you receive. Our community is full of decision-makers who may require your services – remember the UK has more legacy building stock than new build properties so it’s likely some of these tradespeople will need asbestos removal at some point.
And don’t forget about social media. Before and after shots are always well received and give customers a good idea of what you can do. Just remember to use the most appropriate platforms – it makes no sense to post on a professional networking site if you’re going to mainly target homeowners.
Along with digital marketing, you can also use print marketing methods for local areas. It’s great for pulling in business nearby and saving you travel costs in the long run. For homeowners, you could distribute flyers door-to-door in surrounding neighbourhoods or post ads in local newspapers, while for commercial opportunities you can print your own business cards and brochures and hand these to potential clients. These will work even better if you have some case studies to include.
FAQs
How much can I earn as an asbestos removal business owner?
Trained asbestos removers can roughly £25,000 a year, but starting your own business in this trade sector could see you earn even more. By using marketing strategies and building your client base, you’ll benefit from a steady stream of business. As a result, you’ll gain more profit you can take home as earnings.
How much does it cost to start an asbestos removal company?
It’s hard to give exact figures because there are varying costs to take into account. You’ll have to pay fees for registration and insurance, but the amount you spend on equipment will depend on how many tools you already own. Marketing costs will also vary depending on what strategies you decide to use.

How to hide pipes behind a toilet,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/hide-pipes-behind-toilet/,Bathroom,"How to hide pipes behind a toilet

In This Blog: How to hide pipes behind a toilet How to cover toilet waste pipe FAQs People want to know how to hide pipes behind a toilet because of one thing: aesthetics. As bathrooms are often the smallest rooms in our homes, with square footage shrinking and house prices rising, finding ways to maximise your space is a priority.
Enter the wonderful world of hidden pipes! By tucking away those exposed fixtures, your bathroom not only looks better but it feels better.
So, if you’re asking, ‘how do you hide unsightly plumbing?’ and ‘what can I use to hide pipes?’ read on for our top tips. How to hide pipes behind a toilet We’re going to take you through the 5 ways you can hide pipes behind your toilet. But before we get started, it’s worth understanding what kind of pipes you currently have in your bathroom and how to cover each type up.
Every house has supply and drainage systems that supply indirect and direct water to your property through a single stack or two-pipe system. Older houses tend to have indirect two pipe drainage systems while newer properties will use direct and single stack drainage systems.
Now you know what you’re working with, read on for our tips around hiding these affronts to decor.
How can I hide the pipes behind my toilet?
Concealing toilet pipes can be done in several ways, including:
Hiding them with bathroom furniture
Boxing them in with a DIY skirting board
Building fake walls
Installing bespoke storage units
Installing a floating toilet/wall-mounted design
We’re going to take you through each method and the pros and cons of each.

Find bathroom fitters your neighbours recommend  How to cover toilet waste pipe Hide them with bathroom furniture
One of the best ways to hide your unsightly pipes is to redecorate. Cabinets, tallboys, floating furniture and specially designed units that fit around your toilet are all great options. They’re also perfect if you’re looking at ways to save space and maximise the storage capacity in your bathroom.
The pros are a new aesthetic (who doesn’t like a redecoration project?!) but the cons are how much it can start to add up.
Boxing them in with a DIY skirting board
For pipes that run along or near to the ground, boxing them in is a cheaper alternative to buying new furniture and redecorating. This method also doubles up as an extra shelf, which equals more storage opportunities!
The only issue is the labour involved. To get started, you need confidence in your DIY skills, wood such as MDF, a tape measure, nails, hammer and a saw. Wood glue and waterproof stain are also must-haves. And to make sure you end up with a professional finish, we recommend  hiring a handyman your neighbours recommend .
Build a fake wall
For pipes that run up your walls, you can easily hide by installing a fake wall. This isn’t an easy option for everyone, so you’ll need to  hire a builder  to make sure it’s up to spec and doesn’t fall down while you’re on the john.
A plumber and electrician might also be needed if you want to move your toilet or install lights. Fake walls are great options for bathrooms that can handle the design, but as they tend to jut out further from the original wall, some careful planning is needed to make sure it doesn’t look awkward.
Read our guide,  how to design a bathroom like a pro  for more information.
Bespoke storage units
For bathrooms with difficult angles or irregular shapes, hiring a carpenter to build bespoke storage units is worth the investment. Not only will this help you maximise space by utilising every nook and cranny, but the end result will look slick and clean.
Check out our  carpentry prices guide  for more information.
Install a floating toilet design
Floating toilets (aka: wall hung toilets) are contemporary, stylish and space-saving alternatives to traditional units. Consider installing one in your bathroom for a clean and minimalist result. Just don’t forget to get a matching sink to complete the look!
Our  toilet installation cost guide  has everything you need to know about how much this option will set you back.

Find bathroom fitters your neighbours recommend  FAQs Should I hire a professional?
If you’re thinking of attempting any DIY work, we ask you to think about the risks associated with bad repairs – not to mention the extra costs involved when it comes to correcting any mistakes. If you’re in any doubt about taking on a task, we highly recommend  hiring a local expert  your neighbours know and trust.
When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews. Even better, those reviews are from your neighbours and checked by us to make sure they’re legitimate. Not only that, but if you book one of our members for the job, we  guarantee their work,  which gives you the extra peace of mind and security that you and your house is in safe hands.
Are there any ways to conceal pipes cheaply?
If you’re strapped for cash and want a quick way to improve the aesthetic of your pipework, consider painting them and decorating your bathroom using an industrial aesthetic.
You can also replace any old or rusty pipes to make them more attractive. Copper, chrome and satin finishes are all great upgrades.

How to build a wardrobe,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/build-wardrobe/,Bedroom,"How to build a wardrobe

In This Blog: Planning how to build your own fitted wardrobe How much do fitted wardrobes cost? How to make wardrobe doors FAQs Fitted wardrobes are a great way to organise your belongings and make the most of the space and storage in your bedroom. In this guide, we look at some top tips on how to build a wardrobe, so you can free up some much-needed space and make your bedroom a relaxing haven.
As with most home improvement projects, preparation is key when building a built in wardrobe. We’ve pulled together the top things you need to consider when planning your fitted wardrobes, including how to get the most from your new wardrobe and looking at what wardrobe materials you’ll need. Planning how to build your own fitted wardrobe Planning how to  build fitted wardrobes for your home ? Here are our top tips to help you understand how to make fitted wardrobes:
1. Choose the location of your wardrobe
In some bedrooms, it’s obvious where you would build a fitted wardrobe due to either the layout of the room or the presence of doors, windows, radiators or other fixed objects that will dictate where the wardrobe can fit. In other bedrooms, you could have a number of choices for where you’ll be building a built-in wardrobe. If that’s the case, think about what would work best for the flow of the room.
2. Get your measurements right
Once you know where you’re going to build your own fitted wardrobe, the next (and arguably most important) step is to make sure you have all the measurements for the space. Take your time to measure up accurately and make note of all the details, including any alcoves, corners or unusual room layouts that might affect the structure of the wardrobe.
3. Decide the layout
There are a number of questions that you can ask yourself that will help you plan the structure and layout ahead of building a fitted wardrobe:
Do you want swinging, folding or sliding doors?
What are you going to store in the wardrobes – will it just be clothes, shoes and accessories, or do you plan to store other items as well, such as suitcases?
What type of storage do you need for your belongings, i.e. hanging rails, shelves, drawers, hooks, etc?
Do you want to include non-storage features, such as a dressing table or surface to iron clothes on?
Do you need to consider features to help you access the top of your new wardrobe, such as pull-down hanging rails?
Once you have a good idea of what you want and need in your new fitted wardrobes, it’s often a good idea to draw a rough sketch of how you see it looking on the inside.
Top tip:
 When building a fitted wardrobe, use the project as an opportunity to cull clothing and belongings you don’t need or like. Make sure you’re planning a wardrobe for only items that you love so that everything in your new wardrobe makes you happy.

4. Choose your wardrobe materials
Depending on where you’re planning to buy your wardrobe materials from, you’ll need to decide which materials you want to use. Your options will be dictated by your budget, the layout and features you want in your wardrobe, and your own personal taste.
Speak to your local fitted wardrobe suppliers for their  professional advice  and to find out more about the different wardrobe materials that are available.
Top tip:
 Order samples before you place an order. You want to make sure you’re happy with the look and feel of the wardrobe materials before you spend money on the big order.

How to use Nitromors,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/use-nitromors/,Garage,"How to use Nitromors

In This Blog: How to use Nitromors paint remover What is Nitromors? Play if safe and hire a professional painter and decorator FAQs Getting rid of unwanted paint or varnish can be a pain, but there are a number of popular products out there to help you do the job quicker and easier – and Nitromors is one of them.
In this guide, we look at how to use Nitromors paint remover to help you with your home decorating project. As one of the leading brands for stripping paint and varnish, Nitromors has been around since the 1930s and is a popular choice for many DIY enthusiasts. Keep reading to find out more. How to use Nitromors paint remover When you buy Nitromors, you’ll see the manufacturer’s instructions are clearly labelled on the packaging. As with any chemical product you use in your home, it’s important to read all the instructions and make all the recommended preparations before using Nitromors.
Preparation
Your health and safety is always a priority whenever you’re carrying out DIY projects in your home, especially when using chemical products like Nitromors. So here are the tips to prepare:
Always wear protective gloves and safety goggles when handling Nitromors.
Work outside, if possible.
When working indoors, make sure you have good ventilation and keep windows open.
Protect the surrounding area where you’re working with plastic/polythene sheets.
Don’t use Nitromors in direct sunlight.
Never use Nitromors for removing car paint or with plastics.

Find painters your neighbours recommend 
Nitromors instructions
Here’s a quick summary of how to use Nitromors:
Remove the overcap and prepare to fill it.
Pour the Nitromors into the overcap (and immediately replace the cap on the Nitromors bottle).
Apply a thick coat (2-3mm) onto the paint or varnish you want to remove, using a dabbing action to areas of up to 0.5m2.
Leave for 5-10 minutes to allow the paint or varnish to blister and then apply a second coat of Nitromors to the bolstered surface.
Leave for about 40 minutes, but don’t allow it to dry out – if it dries out then reapply a coat.
Remove the blistered paint or varnish using a scraper – or wire wool to remove any stubborn paint.
Repeat the above process if necessary.
Wash the surface using a scourer and cold water mixed with detergent, or use white spirit on fine wood (to avoid raising the grain).
All to dry completely and rub down with fine sandpaper or wire wool. What is Nitromors? Nitromors is a high-strength, all-purpose paint and varnish remover that’s designed for DIY use on wood, metal and masonry. It uses gel technology to break down and blister paint and varnish so that it can then be easily removed. It’s even water washable so that you can easily clean up after you’ve used it.
The main active ingredients of Nitromors previously included dichloromethane (which was the main ingredient) and methanol. However, the ingredients changed in 2009 when the EU introduced legislation banning methylene chloride – a solvent that Nitromors had previously used in their formulation. The current version of All Purpose Nitromors no longer contains dichloromethane. Play if safe and hire a professional painter and decorator If you don’t want to deal with the hassle of removing paint or restoring wood yourself, hire an experienced local painter and decorator to do it for you. Use our quick and easy  online search  to find the best tradespeople in your area. Or use our  get a quote  feature and we’ll find you multiple quotes for the work from local painters and decorators who come recommended by your neighbours.

Find painters your neighbours recommend  FAQs Can you paint after using Nitromors?
You can indeed paint after using Nitromors, but you’ll need to make sure that you’ve properly prepared the surface for repainting. After using Nitromors and leaving the surface to completely dry out, you then need to:
Sand the surface until it’s smooth and blemish-free
Repair any damage to the surface, such as cracks or divots (which you can fill with wood putty and then re-sand down)
After sanding and repairing, carefully wipe down the surface to remove all dust and debris
To achieve the best results for your new paint, apply a primer to the surface first so that the paint can easily bond to it

Part-time plumbing courses,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/part-time-plumbing-courses/,Tag Not Found,"Part-time plumbing courses

Beginning a new career as a plumber is a fantastic opportunity to transform your working life, gain new skills and increase your earning potential. However, taking a full-time apprenticeship or course requires you to work a minimum number of hours a week which may not suit your current lifestyle. Alternatively, taking a part-time plumbing course may give you the flexibility you need.
Whether you’ve just left school or are looking to retrain as a plumber, part-time courses can be extremely convenient. This is especially true if you have children, are already working, or have other demands on your time. There’s already a shortage of plumbers in the UK causing a growing skills gap and a desperate need for skilled professionals, so now is a great time to train as a plumber.
So, keep reading to explore the world of part-time plumbing courses, including timescales and advice.
The benefits of taking a part-time plumbing course
There are many benefits of taking a part-time plumbing course as an alternative to an apprenticeship or full-time course. These include:
Part-time courses offer flexibility meaning you can fit your course around your lifestyle.
You can spread your learning over more time than a full-time course, meaning you’ll be able to learn in smaller chunks. This can mean you feel less stress and pressure.
You can still get hands on experience like you would in an apprenticeship which is essential for a successful start to your career.
You’ll still get a proper qualification at the end of the course, allowing you to start your plumbing career. What’s more, if you’re considering starting your own business why not  join Checkatrade  for extra support and guidance. With access to our members forum, you can ask any burning questions and get advice from other tradespeople. All whilst marketing your business and building a strong customer base.
How to find a part-time plumbing course
Once you’re sure taking a part-time plumbing course is the best option for you, you’ll need to know how to find a course. There are a few ways to do this, such as:
Looking into part-time apprenticeships. You can check with local plumbers to see if they’ll offer you a part-time apprenticeship or you can look online.
Checking with any online course providers as to whether they offer part-time plumbing courses.
Checking with local colleges to see what plumbing training they provide.
Looking on gov.uk careers pages where many courses are listed.
What about plumbing evening courses and weekend plumbing courses?
Often described as plumbing night courses, evening courses are a great choice for anyone who is already working in another field. Many course providers also offer weekend plumbing courses, so during the week you’ll have the freedom to fulfil any other commitments. Plumbing evening and weekend courses are:
Similar to part-time courses in that you only need to attend classes during your evenings or at the weekend.
Perfect if you have a young family who need full time care during the daytime and week days.
Great if you plan to work while training as you’ll have the time to work as many hours as you need.
Can I take an online plumbing course?
You absolutely can take an online plumbing course and many different course providers offer these. However, it’s worth noting that you’ll need hands on training and experience before you can become a qualified plumber.

How to start a curtain fitter business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-start-a-curtain-fitter-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a curtain fitter business

Curtains are a key part of any interior, offering both privacy and style. Domestic properties are rarely found without them and many commercial buildings will favour them for their homely look and feel. For this reason, starting a business in curtain fitting can be very successful, offering tradespeople a steady stream of jobs and the potential to grow.
Being your own boss comes with a number of perks – not least the ability to set your own working hours and choose the types of jobs you take on. Self-employment can of course be a daunting prospect, and even experienced professionals often have many questions before they get up and running. Read on to find out everything you need to know to start your curtain fitting business with confidence. From equipment and skills through to finances and marketing, you’ll soon be fully equipped to go solo.
Are qualifications necessary for starting a curtain fitter business? 
While qualifications aren’t a requirement for curtain fitting, it’s still recommended you have something if you’re looking to start a business in this sector. Qualifications prove you’ve had professional training and will encourage potential customers to trust your skills. The following courses offer direct training in this field – just bear in mind you might need to pay for these:
Level 2 or 3 NVQ Diploma in Fenestration Installation
NDA Diploma in Professional Soft Furnishings and Curtain Making
What equipment do I need for curtain fitting?
Make sure you invest in a full inventory of equipment. You’ll need every tool at your disposal if you want to provide an efficient and professional service that leaves customers satisfied. Otherwise, delays or cutting corners will only damage your reputation and make it more difficult to secure future opportunities.
It’s equally important to purchase high-quality equipment too. Shoddy tools can likewise cause delays if they break and you’ll end up having to fork out for costly replacements. Here are all the necessary essentials for curtain fitting:
Measuring tape
Pencil
Step ladder
Stud finder
Awl
Power drill
Screwdrivers
Wall anchors
Level
CAD software
Don’t forget to invest in a vehicle as well. While your toolkit is not as heavy as other trades, you’ll still need to get around easily between customer sites.
What are the most important skills for starting a curtain fitter business?
As a business owner, you’ll come across challenges in both completing jobs and running your business. That’s why you need a wide skillset to overcome the various scenarios you may face. Here’s a rundown of the most important qualities:
You’ll need some basic maths for accurately measuring installations on the job, as well as managing your business’s finances
A good level of building and construction knowledge will be useful for ensuring the fittings and design are suitable for the interior conditions
Dexterity is vital for precise fittings and hangings
Knowledge of fabrics and materials will be needed for consulting customers and installing different curtain designs correctly
Interpersonal skills are a must for building client relationships and enhancing your business reputation
Knowledge of CAD applications is useful if you’re going to be mocking up designs for customers
How do I set up a curtain fitter business?
The first step will be legally registering with HMRC. During registration, you’ll have the choice of setting up as a sole trader or a limited company.
What works best will ultimately depend on your circumstances, so it’s important that you weigh up the pros and cons and decide what suits best. Sole trading tends to be easier for managing your finances as there’s less paperwork involved – it’s also quicker to sort out. But you’ll have less financial security than you would as a limited company because sole traders are personally liable for any loss or debt incurred. To help you make a better decision, read our full comparison guide  here .
Putting a plan together
There’s no use flying in blind when setting up your curtain fitting business. Make sure you have a plan that covers the ins and outs of your service, along with your target market and long-term goals. This will keep you on track and help to identify gaps that competitors may have missed – remember curtain fitting is a crowded market so you need to offer something different to get an edge.
When outlining your services, try to specialise so that your business is more likely to stand out. You could offer a comprehensive service that provides the materials, as well as the fittings and installation as a complete package. Or, you could offer interior design consultation and help customers choose which fabrics and fittings would be best for their property. You may also offer blinds and shutters as part of your service to cover all bases.
Once you’ve nailed down these details, it’s time to identify your target audience. Homeowners will offer more business opportunities as there’s simply more of them to target, but jobs won’t be as lucrative when compared to working in commercial buildings, like hotels.
You’ll also want to consider your location and what opportunities there are in the area. Are there spas and hotels nearby? Or is it mainly homes? This will determine how you market your business and how secure new jobs.
Setting your price
Pay rate is something you’ll need to consider carefully. If you set your prices too low, you’ll be struggling to make profit. But if it’s too high, you’ll have a difficult time attracting customers. Shop around and look into competitors – these will give you a ballpark figure for the different services they offer. From here, you can offer competitive prices and generate new business without eating into your profit margin. You can also check out our curtain fittings cost guide  here  for further guidance.
Protecting yourself and your business
As with all trades, sometimes you’ll be faced with scenarios where you make a mistake or a client is left unhappy with your work. As such, it’s vital to have insurance in place to protect you from fees and litigation. Here are the main types of insurance you should consider for your curtain fitting business: Public liability insurance  – This policy covers you from compensation or legal fees if a client feels their property has been damaged by the work you’ve carried out. Professional indemnity insurance  – Protects you in the event a customer is left unsatisfied with your work.
Tools insurance – Covers replacement costs if your equipment ends up lost or damaged.
How do I manage my business’s finances? 
Cashflow
Cashflow is essentially all the ingoings and outgoings of your business. Keeping a close eye on this is vital if you’re to have any idea of how well your start-up is doing. By managing your cashflow, you’ll understand if you’re making enough profit and be able to identify where changes can be made if this isn’t the case. Also consider where you can increase revenue without having to change your rates too dramatically. For example, are there cases where you can work smarter and fit in more jobs? Can you save on fuel by grouping jobs together when customers are near one another?
Business loans
On that note, you may find at the beginning your expenditure is higher than your revenue. But this is to be expected due to all the upfront costs when starting your business.
Fortunately, curtain fitting has relatively low overheads, so you shouldn’t need too much investment to get going. But if you’re still concerned or need a little help, a business loan might be useful. Just remember to watch out for the interest rates and always pay back on time.
Taxes
Along with bookkeeping, you’ll also have to keep note of your taxes. Depending on your business structure you’ll be liable for certain taxes, so it’s best to do your research so you know what you should be filing for. Consider hiring an accountant if you’re still unsure as it’s better to be safe than sorry. You can get more information on this by reading our handy guide  here .
How can I grow a curtain fitter business? 
To build both your client base and your reputation, you’ll have to do take advantage of both print and digital marketing.
An online presence is vital for any business nowadays, so you’ll need to consider the best ways to market your start-up using different digital services. Among customers, eight out of ten are aware of Checkatrade, so  signing up to Checkatrade  is guaranteed to greatly expand your online reach and help you come across as a credible business. Not to mention you can benefit from member discounts on business essentials including tools, fuel and insurance. Membership also gets you in front of decision makers, so take a look if you’re aiming to contract out your curtain fitting services or install in commercial buildings.
Social media can also be very effective for boosting your profile – especially in design-led trades like curtain fitting. You can share pictures and videos of your best work, and boost engagement with your brand by sharing regular updates and stories. Curtain fitting easily crosses over into interior design, so consider how you can capture and cross-over into this audience.
That said, don’t forget the value of print.  You can attract homeowners to your service by distributing leaflets or flyers in nearby neighbourhoods – just make sure you’re allowed to and the homes you’re targeting match up with your target market. Printed brochures are also key and give you the opportunity to list everything in detail alongside quality photography.
Don’t forget you can also advertise your business on the go by signwriting your van. This way, you’ll be promoting your services whenever you travel between jobs. For more information on signwriting, check out our guide  here .
FAQs
How much does it cost to start a curtain fitting business? 
Start-up costs can be as little as £1,500 for a curtain fitter business. This will depend on how much you need to invest in equipment, supplies and marketing. You’ll also have to take into account any costs for setting up your own office as well as business registration and insurance.
How much can I earn as a self-employed curtain fitter? 
On average, curtain fitters earn about £30,000 a year, but going self-employed gives you the potential to earn even more as you’ll be setting your own pay rate. As long as you market your business well and build a large client base, you should be able to take home a healthy profit.

Be sure to maintain a high standard of customer service to leave customers happy with your service and encourage recommendations
How do I start my own interior design business?
For legal reasons, you’ll first have to register your business with HMRC. As a part of this process, you’ll also need to decide on a structure for your business. Setting up as a sole trader tends to be simpler, but you’ll be personally responsible for any debt or losses your business suffers. A limited company, on the other hand, grants better financial protection, but comes with more admin and paperwork to manage.
These are just some of the pros and cons to weigh up. For a more detailed comparison of sole traders and limited companies, read our handy guide  here .
Planning your interior design business
Gaining a steady source of work relies on you putting together a solid business plan that outlines your services and target audience. Bringing these two together will allow you to find a niche and capitalise on gaps in the market.
For your services, you’ll want to specialise in an area that matches your interests and expertise. If yours isn’t completely set in stone, here are a few examples of interior design businesses to consider:
Design consultation – offer professional support and advice on just the design stages of an interior
Room expertise – specialise in certain spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms or bedrooms
Interior re-design – help clients to reinvent their interior using the original furniture and furnishings
Home restoration – spruce up antique home interiors that need a revamp
Once you’ve settled on the ins and outs of your service, the next step is to choose your target market. You’ll want to try and identify an audience that’ll be more inclined to hire you, so keep this in mind before offering your services. For example, if your speciality is home restoration, it would be a good idea to target neighbourhoods with older homes.
Make sure you also research your market beforehand to scout out the competition. If there are too many competitors in the area, you may need to rethink your business plan or location. Cities will tend to have more corporate design opportunities, such as in offices, but you’ll need a strong portfolio of work to secure repeat business in this area. Consider how to showcase your work and tailor examples to specific opportunities when you’re first meeting new customers.
Insuring your business
Sometimes clients might not be happy with your work, or you may experience technical difficulties with your equipment. That’s why you need the right insurance policies in place to save you from heavy financial losses. Here are the most important types for an interior design business: Public liability insurance  – This will protect you if a customer feels their property has been damaged by your work
Equipment breakdown insurance – CAD software is pretty essential to your work, so you need financial protection in the event that your computer malfunctions Professional indemnity insurance  – If a customer is unsatisfied with your work, you’ll be covered against any compensation or legal fees
Managing your finances 
As you get your business up and running, make sure you keep a close eye on your finances. The only way you’ll know if you’re making profit is by monitoring your income and expenditure. This way, you can make adjustments to your business to ensure you’re making enough revenue at the end of the day. At the start you may find you’re operating at a loss, but this is expected after the upfront costs of equipment, supplies and such. If this is cause for concern however, you could take out a business loan to cover the expenses.
Don’t forget to file your taxes on a regular basis as part of your bookkeeping. Different taxes apply to different business structures, so it’s important to do your research. If you’re still unsure how to go about documenting your taxes, you can always hire an accountant to help out. For more advice on employing an accountant, read our guide  here .
How do interior designers get clients? 
Marketing is crucial to gaining more business. There are multiple approaches you can use to build your client base and raise your profile.
Digital marketing
Boosting your online presence is a major part of marketing, and  joining Checkatrade  is a sure-fire way to do this. When you become a member, your interior design business is opened up to over three million monthly site users that could become your clients. Not to mention you can enhance your profile by displaying client recommendations and showcasing images of your best finished work.
Showing off your stunning designs is important in this field, so creating profiles on social media is essential for giving people an idea of what you can do. Building your online presence also gives you the chance to interact with other users and build new client relationships.
Setting up a website is another way to establish yourself, while also creating a useful contact point and source of information for clients. You can set this up yourself quite easily by using a simple website template, or you can hire a web designer to put together a more polished page.
Word-of-mouth
While digital marketing is really important, you shouldn’t ignore the value of gaining recommendations via word-of-mouth in a field like interior design. It’s still a really effective way of pulling in clients, so make sure you treat every job as unique. For more handy tips on building your reputation and making your business stand out, read our article  here .
FAQs
How much does it cost to start an interior design business?
The average start-up cost for an interior design business is about £11,500, but this can vary depending on what equipment you already have and whether you’ll be setting up a studio for clients to visit.
Is an interior design business profitable? 
Interior design is experiencing rising demand, so you’re likely to benefit from a steady stream of revenue if you nail your marketing. It also has low overheads to begin with, especially if you’re working on your own, so you can take home more of what you earn.
What’s an interior design business owner’s salary? 
The average salary for interior designers is anywhere between £23,000 and £45,000 a year, but the best agencies often earn far more than this. Find a niche, develop a strong portfolio and take lessons from the most successful companies. You’ll be able to build on their successes and make the step into self-employment that bit easier.

Which tradespeople should you use for the job? If you take a stroll around any village or town you’ll likely see a large number of homes sporting uPVC windows due to their low maintenance and long life.

Spray painting requires considerable skill and years of experience. You do not want uneven coverage or bubbles of excess paint on your window frames. We recommend you get a professional in for this work.

Find painters your neighbours recommend  Tips for painting uPVC windows Whilst you can use paint to transform old frames, it’s never advised that you try to paint new uPVC windows. This is due to the outer layer of the windows that gives them a shiny finish.
It’s generally advised that you wait at least a year before painting these windows.
Once you’ve decided to refresh your uPVC windows it can help to have a little guidance to avoid mistakes. This is especially true if you’re new to DIY and have never painted window frames before. Use the following tips for painting your uPVC windows to get great results:
Choose spray paint as this gives the best coverage and finish.
Make sure to protect the glass parts of your windows. Remember, paint splotches will restrict your views.
Preparation is the key to beautifully painted windows, so make sure to properly clean your frames before beginning.
When painting windows above the ground floor ensure you’re using the right type of ladder and that it’s properly supported. How to paint uPVC windows Start by gathering everything you need, this includes a ladder, paint, tape to protect your window glass, cloths, warm water, sandpaper, a dust mask, goggles and primer.
You can then apply tape around all your windows to prevent any paint from touching the glass or the walls of your home.
Next, take the time to do a thorough clean of your frames. Make sure to remove any debris and dust to create a dry, smooth surface for painting.
Using sandpaper, lightly sand the frames of your windows. This will ensure you have a flat, even surface that the paint will easily stick to.
Top tip: Don’t forget to wipe away any dust from your sandpaper before continuing.
You can then cover your frames with a layer of primer. This will help to improve the appearance and durability of your paint.
Making sure to wear your dust mask and goggles, start spraying your windows. You’ll need to apply about three even coats for the best results but make sure the paint dries between each layer.
Once you’ve completely covered your frames and achieved flawless results, let the paint dry before removing your tape.
Brilliant, you now know how to paint uPVC windows!
If you have any doubt about painting your windows, then do find a professional to do the job for you.

Find painters your neighbours recommend  FAQs Can you paint brown or white uPVC windows?
Absolutely, you can paint any colour of uPVC windows.

Bedec multi-surface paint
Zissner all coat
Selemex direct
Kolorbond original
How can I ensure I get flawless results?

How to start a green oak framing business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-start-a-green-oak-framing-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a green oak framing business

Green oak framing may be an ancient craft but that doesn’t mean it’s outdated. In fact, green oak is a popular choice for many of today’s homes and gardens, offering a rustic beauty with the added benefits of durability and flexibility in design. That’s why many homeowners seek out tradespeople like you who have the skill to bring their designs to life.
Given this demand, it makes perfect sense to start your own green oak framing business and capitalise on the wealth of opportunity out there. That said, making the jump to self-employment can be daunting, so read on to find out everything you need to get up and running.
Do I need qualifications to start a green oak framing business?
It takes a high degree of skill, knowledge and experience to be a green oak framer. Homeowners will want to know their property is in good hands, so it’s a good idea to demonstrate your technical ability through recognised qualifications. You’ll also be more competitive in the market if you have some credentials to back up your services. Even if you’re experienced and have only learned ‘on the job’, it might be useful to consider one of the following courses:
Level 2 or 3 Diploma in Carpentry and Joinery
Level 2 Award in Timber and Panel Products
Level 2 or 3 Diploma in Wood Machining
Intermediate apprenticeship in Carpentry and Joinery
You could also complete a green oak framing course to highlight your knowledge and demonstrate a willingness to complete jobs to the highest standard.
What skills are needed to start a green oak carpentry business?
Whether it’s managing technical projects or keeping on top of your taxes, as a self-employed green oak framer you’ll face day-to-day challenges running your business. As such you’ll need a range of different skills, including:
Building and construction knowledge to conduct site surveys and install green oak framing correctly for different projects
Numeracy skills for managing business finances and putting together accurate frame layouts
Technical understanding to achieve the right specifications and create well-structured framing designs
High level of customer service to help you gain recommendations
Time management for balancing jobs and business admin
Attention to detail to ensure everything is hand-crafted with precision
What equipment is required for green oak framing?
It’s vital to have a full inventory of high-quality tools for a specialist craft like green oak framing. Cutting corners will result in sloppy work that leaves customers unhappy and your business with a poor reputation. Shoddy tools are also more likely to break, resulting in project delays and unnecessary spend for replacements. The following list covers all but the most bespoke projects. You’ll need:
Chisels for wood finishing
Gouges for chopping out mortices
Planes for shaping joints and smoothing surfaces
Drawknives and spokeshaves for removing excess sapwood and shaping edges
Saws for cutting braces and curves
Measuring kit for precise design marking
Drills and augers for drilling peg or pin holes
Protective equipment including goggles, safety boots and ear defenders
Framing pins or pegs for construction and assembly of frames
Keep in mind that you’ll also need a van for transporting all your equipment between jobs, as well as a valid driving licence.
How do I start a green oak framing business?
Before you do anything else, you’ll have to legally register your business as a sole trader or a limited company. Take time to weigh up the differences between these business structures — each has its own pros and cons to consider. For example, sole trading involves much less paperwork but higher tax rates, while limited companies offer greater financial security but more legal responsibilities. For a full overview of the differences, read our handy guide  here .
Green oak framing business plan
You’ll need a thorough business plan that covers the ins and outs of your service, as well as your target audience and long-term goals. Green oak framing is quite a specialised trade, but that doesn’t mean you can’t make your service unique. You could specialise in new-build extensions, gardens and porches, or look to repair and renovate older outhouses and barns. Bear in mind that any retrofitting may require extra support, like an assessment from a structural engineer to determine soundness.
Once you’ve settled on your area of expertise, you should identify a target market. The most successful green oak framing businesses rely on steady demand, so it’s important to identify a market that’s likely to need your services and isn’t oversubscribed. For instance, if you specialise in green oak framing for barns, you’ll want to be approaching affluent rural neighbourhoods to maximise business. There may also be opportunities on smaller new-build estates that are looking to keep design similar to other properties in the area – you’ll need to approach developers if this sounds of interest. Older, listed buildings in cities may also have a lot of oak framing in need of repair or reconstruction. Do your research and assess where competitors are absent.
Insurance 
Your day-to-day business will involve a lot of hand crafting and working at height, which can unfortunately leave room for accidents. That’s why it’s crucial to protect yourself and your business with insurance. Here are the types you’ll need: Public liability insurance  – Protects your business against claims made by customers if an injury occurs or they believe you’ve damaged their property.
Employers’ liability insurance – If you take on employees, you’re legally required to have them covered with this insurance policy. Professional indemnity insurance  – In the event you make a mistake in your work that causes the customer financial loss.
Tools insurance – Covers the cost of replacing your tools if they’re lost or damaged due to flooding, theft or fire.
Pay rate
Green oak framers usually charge around £2000 per square metre of floor area, but you should do your own local research before settling on pricing. Scouting out competitors and their price structures allows you to get a good idea of the market and where you may be able to offer savings. But be careful not to set your prices too low, or you may find yourself struggling to cover expenses and make a profit.
How do I manage my finances?
To keep your business running smoothly, you’ll need to keep on top of all your revenue and outgoings.
Cashflow 
Simply put, cashflow is income versus expenditure for your business. It’s vital you keep an eye on your cashflow to ensure you’re making profit at the end of the day. You may initially find yourself running at a loss, but this is expected because of the upfront costs you’ll be paying for equipment, insurance and registration. Those studying for carpentry qualifications may also find they’re paying more to being with. For helpful tips on managing cashflow, read our article  here .
Taxes 
You should file your taxes on a regular basis to avoid drowning in paperwork come the new financial year. Different taxes will apply depending on your business structure, so make sure you’re aware of which you need to be documenting. If you find yourself needing help or advice, you could hire an accountant. This will allow you to focus on the technical side of oak framing without having to worry about the numbers. Read our guide  here  for more information on accounting services.
How can I market my green oak framing business?
If you want to maximise opportunities, you’ll need to rely on more than just word-of-mouth recommendations. Using different marketing strategies is essential for raising your profile and acquiring more business.
Digital marketing Signing up to Checkatrade  is one of the best ways to market your business online. Three times as many consumers use Checkatrade for hiring tradespeople compared to similar directories, so you’ll certainly be gaining maximum promotion for your business. Not only this, Checkatrade improves the SEO for your business which is really helpful for enhancing visibility — especially for a niche trade like green oak framing.  and
Setting up your own website is another way to establish an online presence for your business with relative ease. You could use a simple template to put your website together, or hire a freelance designer to create your site for a one-time fee. If you want to keep costs low, you can even use a free online template to get started. Having a website gives customers a handy source of contact details and information, plus it builds a recognisable brand for your business.
Green oak framing is a visual trade and lends itself well to good photography. Consider investing in a good camera to share your best work – this can then be shared on social media to give customers an idea of skills. Before and after shots are very popular on trade accounts.
Print marketing 
While online marketing is great for reaching out to large audiences, print marketing can still be very effective for building a local reputation and securing new clients in your area. One approach you can use is door-to-door distribution of leaflets advertising your services. You never know, there may be several homeowners in your area thinking about building a framed extension or garage to improve their property. You could also place an advertisement in the local newspaper to promote your business in surrounding neighbourhoods.
Your van is a perfect tool for marketing. Simply have signwriting applied, including your business name and contact details, to turn your van into a 24/7 advertisement as you travel between jobs. If you’re a Checkatrade member, you could also add the Checkatrade logo to promote your credibility and enhance your image. For more advice on buying vehicle graphics, read our guide  here .

In This Blog: What are the latest UK bathroom trends? Smart bathroom innovations Current bathroom tile trends Bathroom trends to avoid Latest bathroom paint trends Popular bathroom flooring trends What are the latest trends in bathroom mirrors? Ready to give your bathroom a makeover? How much does a new bathroom cost to be installed by a professional? Which tradespeople should you use for the job? We use our bathrooms every day, often with little time to spare, meaning these spaces need to be clean, tidy, and organised to keep up with our busy lives. As well as being functional, bathrooms need to be visually appealing, making our daily tasks more enjoyable.
If you’re feeling dissatisfied with your current bathroom, are looking for a change, or want to upgrade your space with bathroom innovations, you’ve come to the right place.
Let’s take a look at some of the latest bathroom trends of 2022. What are the latest UK bathroom trends? Whilst it’s true that some bathroom trends come and go, this isn’t always the case. Many trends are here for the long term and will look amazing for years to come.
To help you get started, the below list covers a few of the fantastic current and upcoming bathroom trends in the UK:
Marble:
 Often found in homes throughout the country, marble is a beautiful material, although it can be costly. Many people are now choosing to decorate their bathrooms with green marble for a unique touch.
Patterns:
 Instead of opting for simplistic bathroom decoration, using patterned wallpaper is sure to wow guests.
Natural
: To bring the outside inside, choose natural materials and shades for your bathroom.
Warmth:
 Using warmer colours like oranges and browns creates a cosy, safe space where you can relax. In fact, terracotta tiles are the perfect way of embodying this trend. Smart bathroom innovations Building a bathroom that meets your needs (this could be a space for relaxation, hygiene essentials, or a family bathroom for young children) is vital. A great way of doing this is to introduce one or more smart bathroom innovations. Below are a few of the options available to you:
Self-cleaning
: Many of us are always running from one place to the next so finding time to clean your toilet can be tricky. Enter self-cleaning toilets, a fantastic bathroom innovation that ensures your toilet is always squeaky clean.
Heating:
 From warm toilet seats to underfloor heating and heated towel rails, staying warm in your bathroom during the colder months is essential.
Steam:
 If you have the space, you can install a steam shower in your bathroom. With a seat for resting, steam jets fill the shower with heated water vapour to help relieve tension and stress.
Taps:
 You can now purchase taps that have small sensors that notice movement. The taps will then only turn on when your hands are positioned underneath them, helping to reduce water wastage.

Find recommended bathroom designers near you  Current bathroom tile trends Tiles are one of the first things people notice and have a huge influence on the feel and appearance of your bathroom. That’s why following current bathroom tile trends can help you to transform your space.
Use the following tile ideas to update your bathroom:
Matte
: An alternative to shiny glossy tiles, matte tiles are a sophisticated new bathroom trend. They’re easy to maintain and create a softer finish in your bathroom.
Shapes
: Instead of using square or rectangular bathroom tiles, other shapes like hexagons are becoming more popular.
Bold patterns
: You can easily increase the impact of your bathroom tiles by choosing a bold, dramatic pattern.
Neutral colours
: Whites, beiges, and greys are all very popular and help to create a soothing, calming space. Bathroom trends to avoid When decorating a bathroom most people spend a little time looking at current trends. However, some trends can lead to future regrets and more costly renovations. Below we’ve collected some of the bathroom trends to avoid when designing your dream bathroom:
Not adding a bath
If you’re someone who’s always in a hurry, you might not have time to take a bath every day. In this case, it makes sense to just install a large shower instead, right?
Well, consider what’ll happen if you choose to start a family. Babies can’t just hop into the shower, and you may not trust your young children to take a shower safely. Without a bath, you’ll have nowhere to bathe your child. This is equally true if you sell your home to someone with a young family.
Walk-in showers
While these showers seamlessly blend into your picturesque bathroom, without a shower door and sufficient drainage, water can spread throughout the space. This means water stains and marks will cover your entire bathroom floor, requiring extra cleaning time.
In addition, after your shower, your bathroom floor will be wet, not great news if you later need the toilet or to use your sink.
Patterned tiles
If you’re looking to create a bold finish to your bathroom, patterned tiles are a great choice.
However, over time your taste may change and what was once a stunning bathroom feature can become overbearing and jarring.
Hidden pipes
Wall-mounted toilets, basins and taps are the perfect option for minimalist bathrooms, making your room feel spacious and tidy.
Unfortunately, when pipes and fittings are hidden behind walls, any issues will also happen behind your bathroom tiles making repairs very tricky. Latest bathroom paint trends If tiles don’t fit with your interior design style, you may wish to consider painting your bathroom walls. Luckily you can buy paint that is water resistant and well suited to use in a bathroom.
For inspiration, try the following bathroom paint trends:
Light purple
: Adding lavender tones can bring a tranquil, calming feel to your bathroom.
Blues and turquoises
: The best way to create a soothing bathroom with nautical vibes.
Yellows
: A perfect choice to add a sunny, bright effect to your bathroom.
Greens and earth tones
: If you’re looking for a natural space that is full of life, consider using earth tones and bold greens. Popular bathroom flooring trends The floor in your bathroom is easy to forget about but will easily ruin a great bathroom design if it’s subpar.
That’s why it makes sense to consider incorporating one of the below popular bathroom flooring trends into your home:
Black and white
: Using white tiles with black lined patterns is a great choice and this monochromatic, modern trend is here to stay.
Underfloor heating
: If your bathroom is on the small side, why not remove your old radiator and instead have underfloor heating fitted? You’ll save space and ensure that your feet stay warm on even the chilliest of mornings.
Wood effect
: With cool grey tones or warm wood tones, bathroom tiles with the appearance of wooden floorboards are one of the most popular bathroom flooring trends available.
Geometric:
 Bathroom tiles that come in different geometric shapes are very sought after now. Whether these are alternative shapes like hexagons or more linear patterns, they create a beautiful finish to any bathroom. What are the latest trends in bathroom mirrors? You may use your bathroom mirror to put on your make up, style your hair, or shave before work. No matter the reasons, every well finished bathroom needs a sparkling mirror.
Wondering what the latest trends in bathroom mirrors are? Well, consider the following:
Fog free
: You can now purchase mirrors that won’t steam up even after long hot showers or baths. This makes it so much easier to get ready without constantly having to wipe condensation off the mirror.
Round
: Circular or oval mirrors are very popular right now, giving a softer, more calming finish to your bathroom.
Asymmetrical: 
Gone are the days when bathroom mirrors were a basic square shape. You can now choose an asymmetrical mirror that adds visual interest and makes a bold statement. Ready to give your bathroom a makeover? Having a beautifully decorated bathroom makes daily tasks more enjoyable and pleasant. No one wants to spend time in a dated, worn-down space that simply isn’t functional.
Luckily, by using some of the ideas in this guide you can create a bathroom you’re proud of, but you’ll likely need a little professional help to realise your dream.
From tiling to painting and bathroom fitting, our experts are here to bring your plans to life in a fraction of the time it’d take to do the work yourself. We can help to take the stress out of picking a tradesperson as our members are fully checked and recommended by your neighbours. Simply use our free search feature to connect with a range of professionals in your area.
Need the assistance of a few different tradespeople? Our  request a quote feature  takes the hassle out of finding multiple workers for your bathroom project. Just pop in the details of your job and we will send it to three of our trusted professionals. They’ll then either ask for more information or send you a quote, it couldn’t be easier! How much does a new bathroom cost to be installed by a professional? If sprucing up your current bathroom isn’t an option, you may prefer to start from scratch with a full bathroom renovation. This needn’t be too costly with the wide range of bathroom fittings and fixtures available, but you may need to shop around to get the best prices. Want to learn more? Our  new bathroom cost guide  is full of prices, tips and advice.
Alternatively, if you aren’t sure where to begin, our  bathroom ideas guide  is the perfect source of inspiration. Here you’ll find a range of fantastic ideas to create your perfect bathroom. In addition, if you’d like to build a more sustainable space, our  5 ideas for an eco-friendly bathroom  is a great read. Which tradespeople should you use for the job? This will depend on what exactly you’d like to change about your bathroom. For tiling you could hire a tiler, a decorator could help with painting, and if you want a new bathroom suite fitted you’ll need the services of a bathroom fitter.
Most general builders can help with bathroom renovations, so based on the scope of your plans, they may be a great choice as well.

How to start a network engineering business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-start-a-network-engineering-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a network engineering business

Nowadays, almost every company will rely on a computer network to access and share information across their organisation. With networks being such an important part of working life, it’s no surprise that engineers are highly valued for their ability to upgrade, maintain or troubleshoot systems.
That’s why going self-employed in the industry is such a great opportunity. Not only will you be able to profit from plenty of business, but you’ll also have the freedom to choose your working hours, specialisms and customers.
This guide covers everything you need to know, from equipment through to business planning, so you can start your own network engineering business and take that next step in your career.
Do I need qualifications to become a self-employed network engineer?
Network engineering is a highly skilled role that usually requires qualifications, so potential clients will be a lot more likely to hire you if you have the right credentials. While not essential, here are the most recognised qualifications that will highlight you as a reliable tradesman:
Undergraduate degree in network engineering or a related field
Level 4 Certificate in Network Services
Level 4 Diploma in Network Security
Network cable installer advanced apprenticeship
Network engineer higher apprenticeship
Degree apprenticeship in digital and technology solutions
How can I make my business stand out? 
Alongside qualifications, you could seek further certification by joining a relevant trade association. Joining The Chartered Institute for IT recognises your competence and high standard of work in the network engineering industry. Becoming an official member could potentially give you an edge over the competition when seeking new customers.
What skills are important for starting a network engineering business?
You’ll come across a range of challenges while completing jobs and running your business network engineering business, so you’ll need a wide skillset. Here are the most important qualities:
Thorough understanding of computer operating systems for designing, configuring or troubleshooting different networks
Systems, hardware and software knowledge
Attention to detail for spotting issues and protecting networks
Analytical thinking to evaluate network performance and security
Problem solving and troubleshooting skills for resolving network issues
Ability to lead and manage projects
Basic maths for managing your business’s financials and taxes
Teamwork, especially alongside a client’s in-house IT team
Interpersonal skills for building business relationships and providing a high standard of customer service
What equipment is required for network engineering?
Having the right equipment is key for completing jobs quickly and to a high standard. The following list covers the essential for most day-to-day work:
Software tools for analysing and troubleshooting networks
Ethernet cable
RJ45 female-to-female connector for ethernet extension
Serial to ethernet adapter
USB to serial adapter
Screwdriver for dismantling and replacing systems
Cable tester
Tone probe to trace cable routes
Cable snake to keep wiring tidy
How can I start a network engineering business?
First, you must legally register your network engineering business with HMRC and choose a name. Try to make it short, catchy and relevant to your services. This is more likely to stick with potential clients – especially in a competitive market like IT.
You’ll also need to choose a recognised structure for your business. You can set up as a sole trader or as a company, and each has its own pros and cons. For instance, sole trading requires less paperwork but you’ll be personally responsible for any losses or debt your business incurs, whereas a limited company structure gives you more financial security but less privacy around your profit and earnings. Read our full guide  here  on the differences to help you make a decision.
Plan your network engineering service 
It’s important to have a clear idea of the type of you work you’ll be offering. Network engineers typically focus on delivering high-availability network infrastructure, but roles can overlap with computer network architects, security systems engineers or professionals within a client organisation. If you’re not quite sure what you want to specialise in yet, here are several network engineer business ideas you can use for inspiration:
Network performance consultancy – Analyse network performance and advise on updates or changes that should be made
Troubleshooting service – Monitor networks, identifying and resolving any issues that crop up
Network design and configuration – Put together network designs for businesses and install the equipment
Network security – Maintain firewalls, update virus protection software and perform data backups
Choose a target market 
As a network engineer you could expand your services across a huge range of different businesses. But to begin with, it’s advisable to focus on a couple of key sectors and develop your portfolio from there.
Healthcare and education have large estates requiring extensive networking, though they can be difficult markets to break into. Contracts in corporate offices, on the other hand, are very common and the technical challenges are often more straightforward. Be sure to consider the types of businesses in your local area before settling on a target market – research and planning is key.
Insuring your network engineering business
Network engineering is technical work that can involve the handling of valuable or sensitive data, so there’s always a small chance of something going wrong. That’s why it’s essential to protect you and your business with relevant insurance policies. Here are the main types you should consider: Professional indemnity insurance  – You’ll be dealing with numerous companies in your line of work, so this will cover your business if clients are unhappy with any work you’ve completed
Employers’ liability insurance – If you decide to take on employees, you’ll be legally required to have this cover in place
Cyber and data insurance – Your business centres around computer systems, so it’s essential for you to have protection against data breaches or hacks
How to run your network engineering business
While it’s not the most exciting thing about owning a business, bookkeeping is crucial. You’ll need to monitor your ingoings and outgoings to ensure you’re making profit at the end of the day. Bear in mind your expenditure may outweigh your revenue in the beginning due to start-up costs, which is perfectly normal. If this is a concern for you however, consider taking out a business loan to cover the initial costs of registration, equipment and insurance.
Don’t forget to manage your taxes as well. Different taxes apply to different business structures, so make sure you understand what taxes you need to be documenting. If you’re not sure, consider employing an accountant to help you file your taxes. Read our handy article  here  for more information on hiring accountant services.
Hiring a team
As your business grows, you may be faced with larger projects or an increased workload across different sites that you’ll need help with. Make sure your candidates have a solid CV with all the necessary skills and experience to be a competent network engineer. However, they may have learned ‘on the job’ and worked their way up, so it’s always best to meet potential colleagues in person. Attitude is massively important for a new business, so play close attention to their manner and approach. After all, they’ll be representing your business.
Marketing your network engineering business
Devising an effective marketing strategy will be key to securing more opportunities and building your business’s reputation. Seeing as you’ll be working directly with other organisations, it’s important to employ the right approaches for targeting these particular clients.  Signing up to Checkatrade  is a great way to raise your profile as it opens up your service to over three million monthly site users that could become your clients. You’ll also be able to interact with other members community, build trade relationships and gain valuable industry insight.
Social media is another useful marketing tool for your business. Setting up a profile gives you a platform to expand your audience, allowing you to interact with potential clients in your target market and drum up new business.
FAQs
Are network engineers in demand?
Most businesses are reliant on computer networks for both sharing and protecting valuable information, but maintaining these systems is very technical work. That’s why the skills of a network engineer are highly sought after for configuring and servicing networks. It is certainly a profession in demand, making it the perfect opportunity to start your own business.
How much can I earn as a self-employed network engineer?
Your earnings as a self-employed network engineer will vary depending on the demand for services and your rates, but here are some ballpark figures:
Network engineers with several years of experience earn on average £29,000 year.
Network engineers with a lot of experience under their belt earn around £40,000 a year.
As a network engineering business owner, you could potentially earn even more if you’re receiving a steady stream of opportunities. This will rely on you establishing a niche and marketing your business effectively.

Guide to low energy lighting,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/low-energy-lighting/,Living Room,"Guide to low energy lighting

In This Blog: What is low energy lighting? Common low energy lighting solutions Benefits of LED lighting FAQs When it comes to easy ways to make your home greener and save you money, low energy lighting is a no-brainer. Whether it’s for ceiling lights, uplighters, lamps or outdoor lighting, there are lots of low energy lighting solutions available.
The most popular low energy lighting options are LED lighting and compact fluorescent lighting. Keep reading to find out more about what they are and why you need them. What is low energy lighting? Simply put, low energy lighting works using low energy bulbs that use less electricity than standard lighting solutions. You’ll most likely have seen LED or compact fluorescent lighting, which – thanks to advances in modern technology – now give excellent lighting for a fraction of the running costs.
Switching to low energy lighting in your home might involve an initial outlay for low energy bulbs, which tend to cost more than standard bulbs, but they’ll last a lot longer. That means low energy lighting options will save you money both through using less energy on a daily basis (so your electricity bills will be lower) and also not needing to be replaced so often. It’s a win-win situation.
Want to know how else you can reduce the environmental impact of your home? Check out these other  green home ideas .

Find low energy lighting expert near you  Common low energy lighting solutions If you’re looking for low energy lighting solutions in the UK, the two most popular choices you have are Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs). Both offer excellent quality, cost-effective options for most general lighting needs.
LED lighting vs compact fluorescent lighting
Both LED and CFL lighting will save you a few bob every year, especially if you replace all of your standard lighting with low energy alternatives. Here are a few points to think about if you’re trying to decide between LEDs and CFLs:
LEDs are generally considered to be more efficient than CFLs, and will save you more money in the long run
Nowadays, both LEDs and CFLs are good options for replacing bulbs for most types of household lighting
CFL bulbs tend to be cheaper than LED bulbs
CFL bulbs are what most people understand to be energy-efficient light bulbs
If you need a very bright single bulb to light a room, a CFL is more suitable than an LED
CFL bulbs usually take a small amount of time to reach full brightness
Interested in LED lighting? Find out more about prices in our guide on  how much LED lights cost to run .
Low energy outdoor lighting
There are a number of low energy outdoor lighting options available so that your garden, patio, decking, paths and other outdoor spaces can benefit from energy-saving lights. You can even opt for solar-power outdoor lighting that will charge during the day using the sun’s rays, and then use the stored power to light up when it goes dark.
Low energy commercial lighting
Commercial lighting has historically been one of the worst culprits for energy-wasting, but all that is changing. Previously used incandescent or halogen light bulbs, which waste up to 95% of their electricity due to heat loss, are being replaced with low energy alternatives, like LEDs.
The EU has actually introduced regulations to phase out inefficient lighting in order to improve energy efficiency across Europe. This means that companies now have to replace their old energy-wasting bulbs with alternative low energy commercial lighting solutions.
Other low energy lighting options
If you’re ready to make the switch and replace your old inefficient light bulbs and lighting solutions, it’s good to know that you have lots of options for low energy lighting, including:
Low energy track lighting
Low energy high bay lighting
Low energy bathroom lighting
Low energy ceiling lighting
Low energy kitchen lighting
To find out more about exact costs, we recommend speaking to your local
 low energy lighting suppliers
 for their advice and quotes.

Find low energy lighting expert near you  Benefits of LED lighting Here are some of the reasons why you might want to start shopping for LED lighting for your home:
LEDs are the most energy-efficient bulbs on the market
They use 90% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs
LED lights can last up to 30 years
There’s no delay as LEDs give out light almost instantly
LED lighting works well in low temperatures (unlike CFLs) FAQs What is LED lighting?
LED lighting is a modern low energy lighting solution that was introduced to provide a more energy-efficient alternative to standard incandescent lights. LED light bulbs are generally more expensive than standard light bulbs and can cost up to £20 each for the brightest bulbs. That said, they’ll last a lot longer and will use a lot less energy – so you’ll save money in the long run.
How does LED lighting work?
LED lighting, or light-emitting diodes, produce light by using a semiconductor that emits light energy when an electrical current is passed through it. They work differently compared to standard incandescent light bulbs, which work by passing electricity through a thin wire filament.
How do compact fluorescent bulbs work?
When it comes to low energy lighting, compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs work differently to LED lighting. Instead of using a semiconductor, CFL bulbs pass energy through mercury vapour to create UV light that glows when it’s absorbed by a phosphor coating inside the bulb.

In This Blog: What is a septic tank drainage field? How much does a new septic drain field cost? How does a drainage field work? What’s the difference between a soakaway and a drainage field? Drainage field calculation Drainage field design Septic tank leach field sizes explained FAQs A septic tank drainage field is part of a septic system. It transports the wastewater back to the soil. After treatment and separation within the septic tank, water flows into a drainage field where it’ll organically filter through gravel, soil, and sand in a purification process before reaching the water table.
Often, the first indication of a leach field issue is the smell of sewage in your property or a swampy area in the garden.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now What is a septic tank drainage field? A septic tank drainage field – also known as a leach drain or leach field – sits beneath the ground. It’s made up of a variety of perforated pipes which border the septic tank. It eliminates pollutants and contaminations from liquid once it makes its way into the septic tank. How much does a new septic drain field cost? Septic tank drainage field costs vary depending on its size and type. On average, you’ll pay about 
£3,700 
for the supply and installation of a 2,800 litre septic tank. For a larger septic tank (4,800 litres), you can expect to pay around 
£5,300 
for supply and installation.
The cost to install a septic drain field ranges from 
£3,000 – £7,000
.

Find a septic tank drainage field specialist  How does a drainage field work? The wastewater and waste from your property will flow into the septic tank, and thanks to the bacteria present, the water starts decomposing. The solid waste then falls to the foot of the septic tank and becomes sludge.
Fats, oils, grease, and other liquid waste floats on the top of the septic tank and the bacteria will break it down. The liquid waste then flows into the drainage field via underground pipework, whilst the solid waste stays at the foot of the septic tank where the bacteria continues breaking it down.
Finally, the liquid flows through the draining field’s pipework before running into the earth, where it’s naturally purified by the soil. What’s the difference between a soakaway and a drainage field? A rainwater soakaway is used to enable rainwater to infiltrate through the ground. Usually, it’s built by fitting soakaway crates within the earth to enable a substantial volume of water to come in and gradually empty away. You can only use a soakaway for surface water and rainwater.
A drainage field on the other hand is a loop of slotted pipes on and around a bed of gravel. It allows wastewater to run through the bed of gravel so that any bacteria will form there. This in turn removes contaminants from the water before it enters the ground. Drainage field calculation Apply your percolation test results to determine the floor area needed for your leach field. Use our drainage field calculator to work out the size of the field:
At
 (floor area) = 
p
 (number of occupants in your property) x 
Vp
 (percolation value in mm/secs) x 
0.25. Drainage field design It should be a minimum of 10 metres from any permeable drain or watercourse
It must be a minimum of 50 metres from a water abstraction point
It must be adequately far away from other leach fields, soakaways, or mounds
It should be a minimum of 15 metres from any construction
To protect abstracted drinking water, it shouldn’t be in an Environment Agency Source Protection Zone
If you do not own sufficient land to install a drainage field, consider a sewage treatment plant as an alternative to a septic tank and drainage field.
The design and installation of a drainage field should follow relevant British standards and building regulations Septic tank leach field sizes explained Leach fields should be at least 50 metres from a water abstraction point, 10 metres from a watercourse, and 15 metres from any construction.

Find a septic tank drainage field specialist  FAQs What is the purpose of a drain field?
A drain field is a covered, shallow pit made up of unsaturated soil. Without one, a septic tank would just overspill, produce overflow, and create a bad smell in your garden.
How do you build a drain field?
Building a drain field is best left to a drainage and sewer installation specialist. You can find out all the costs associated with  fitting a septic tank  in our expert guide. Be aware that you’ll need to have a  septic tank inspection  done, which involves a thorough check of the pipework and tank. This often requires  emptying the tank , too, with tradespeople using CCTV technology to inspect pipework.
If, however, you’re confident to do this yourself, here are a few pointers to bear in mind:
Choose your location (make sure it’s away from your property)
Get in touch with the authorities, as you may need a permit, and also, the site may need to be inspected before the work’s carried out
Ensure the soil’s right
Have the soil tested
Begin digging!

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Fitting roof vents stop loft spaces from becoming too warm or too cold and help prevent moisture build-up.
Enabling air circulation in your loft is just as vital as  boarding your loft  and insulating it properly. So, if condensation’s present in your loft space, installing roof vents will combat this as well as keeping the air circulating correctly for a more regulated temperature.
If you’re having a  new roof installed , it’s also worth mentioning to your roofer about having loft vents installed at the same time, as doing so will prevent issues further along the line. Roof vent costs Roof ventilation costs start at around 
£250 
for 20 circular/eaves vents – this would include fitting them in the front and back of your terraced or semi-detached house.
To fit four roof vent tiles, you’d be looking at a price of roughly 
£400,
 while fitting four ridge vents to a standard house would cost about 
£350.
There are three kinds of loft vents available, so we advise fitting a minimum of one type, but it’s best to fit two types, as all three would be a little too much. Roof vent installation costs A roofer will typically charge 
£150 – £250
 per day and, normally, they’ll work in pairs to carry out the task safely and efficiently.

Find a roofer your neighbours recommend  Roof ridge vent installation cost It costs roughly 
£650
 for a roofer to fit four roof ridge vents and 20 eaves vents to a two-storey semi-detached property, plus a day’s labour. The overall price will depend on the size, type, and the number of units you want fitting. Roof vent repair cost On average, a roofer will charge 
£650
 to repair four tiles and 20 eaves vents.
When selecting a roofing installer, a great place to start is searching on Checkatrade. Our members are reviewed by your neighbours and checked again by us to ensure the reviews are 100% genuine.
You can easily get three quotes from roofers near you using our  request a quote  feature. Simply enter information about your job and we’ll send it to three roofers near you. Roof vent replacement cost Most roofers will charge a flat rate for labour, which ranges between 
£250-£350 
per day, with vents costing well over 
£250
.
To be sure you’re hiring the right roofer, we advise comparing quotes. FAQs What kinds of roof vents are available?
There are three types of loft or roof vents to consider:
Ridge vents
 – positioned at the roof’s highest point (the ridge).
Tile vents
 – replace tiles mid-roof and work well with most roof tiles in the UK market.
Eaves/soffit vents 
– circular vents that are often fitted together with ridge vents for extra ventilation to enable airflow to the loft.
If you’re worried about the ventilation in your loft, it may be worth having  soffit vents  installed. These types of vents are fitted underneath the eaves of your roof to enable fresh air to pass into your loft.

LVT flooring cost guide,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/lvt-flooring-cost/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Conservatory, Kitchen, Living Room","LVT flooring cost guide

In This Blog: How much does LVT flooring cost in the UK? How much does LVT flooring cost to install in the UK? Cost of luxury vinyl flooring installed vs standard vinyl flooring FAQs Luxury vinyl tiles (LVT) look similar to real stone or wood and you can have numerous designs printed on them. The key difference is that they provide a whole raft of benefits over real stone or wood.
Produced in shapes of planks or tiles, LVT flooring is still a fairly new product – one of the fastest growing in the flooring market. Many people choose to install it in areas where water is present, such as kitchens or bathrooms. It’s often known as “luxury vinyl tiles” or “click vinyl”.
Want to know the costs of installing this durable, natural-looking flooring in your home? Here’s all you need to know when it comes to LVT flooring costs.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now How much does LVT flooring cost in the UK? The cost of LVT flooring is around 
£45
 per metre square. However, LVT flooring prices depend on the kind bought, material required for preparation, and labour. It’s more than possible to fit the flooring yourself, but most people opt for an experienced contractor so the task’s done properly and fast. When considering the average cost of luxury vinyl flooring, you’ll need to think about both.
Several installers will include the removal of your existing flooring in the price and will also throw in the cost of taking this away when discarding the old flooring. That said, this isn’t always the case, so double-check the quote they’ve provided includes the disposal and removal of the old flooring.
If not, you can normally pay an additional fee to have the flooring disposed of, which is around 
£120.
Alternatively, you could  hire a skip , which will cost around 
£165 – £425
 (depending on the size of the skip and your location)
. How much does LVT flooring cost to install in the UK? You can expect to pay from 
£180 to £300 
per day to have luxury vinyl flooring installed. However, this depends on a couple of things.
Firstly, you’ll probably get a reduced rate if you ask your local flooring installer to work on a few jobs, thus, giving them more work. Aside from this, the cost of flooring installation specialists varies, depending on where you live.
Installation costs consist of getting the surface prepared, so expect to pay between
 £2 – £13
 per square metre plus the cost of underlay, which is roughly 
£3 – £7
 per square metre. Labour prices range considerably depending on which kind of vinyl flooring you opt for and which type of surface the vinyl will be laid on.
You can expect to pay a professional floor installer an average of 
£200
 per day, while the price of preparing the surface will hinge on what floor type you have.
If you’re looking at having a herringbone pattern installed, this is more complex. For example, you’re looking at roughly 
£60 
per metre square for the fitting, a further 
£60
 per metre square for supplying high-end flooring, and 
£10
 per metre square for preparation. This gives a total cost of 
£130
 per metre square for herringbone installation. You may not mind paying the installation premium because it does look good!
With the price of herringbone in mind, a room of, say, 18 metres square would cost 
£2,340
, half of which would be labour, so approximately 
£1,200.
 The cost of 
£1,200
 equates to a tradesperson for four days, assuming their rate is 
£300
 per day.

Find recommended vinyl floor installers near you  Cost of luxury vinyl flooring installed vs standard vinyl flooring When it comes to the LVT fitting cost, it’s best to choose a local flooring specialist through Checkatrade. You can trust our recommendations, as the reviews are from your neighbours. And we check the reviews to make sure they’re genuine.
Standard kitchen vinyl costs vary, with the average  cost of installing vinyl flooring in a kitchen  being 
£530
 – based on a floor area of 18.5 square metres.
You’ll also have to bear in mind 
£200 – £400
 for the materials and installation needed for standard vinyl flooring in a medium-sized kitchen, for example. FAQs What’s the average cost of luxury vinyl flooring?
The average cost for luxury vinyl flooring is between 
£25 – £40 
per square metre if you opt for mid-end quality LVT. You’ll then pay for the surface preparation which is roughly 
£10
 per metre square plus about 
£7
 for the underlay. Finally, you’ll need to account for the installation, which is approximately 
£200.
Next, there’s a fee to have your old flooring removed, so expect to pay about
 £120 
for this.
You can request that your installer buys the materials for you, however, most people purchase the supplies themselves.
What kinds of LVT flooring is available?
Luxury vinyl tiles come in three kinds, including:
Stick down
 – stuck straight to the subfloor.
Locking system
 – the boards lock into each other on top of the underlay and is otherwise known as a “floating floor”.
Loose lay
 – laid over most subfloors with zero preparation and zero underlay.
All three are crafted from PVC, meaning they’re incredibly hard-wearing. With durable surfaces and totally waterproof, too, they’re ideal for fitting in any room you like!

In This Blog: Cost to check home lift How to test home lift A guide to lift regulations UK FAQs Maintaining your domestic lift or stairlift regularly is as important as regularly servicing your car to make sure it works properly. As well as the  cost of installing a home lift , you’ll have to factor in the costs of checking and testing it frequently to keep your domestic lift in tip-top condition.
Lift servicing may also stop other expensive repairs from being performed, thanks to early fault-finding before a more complex issue strikes.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Cost to check home lift The cost of checking your home lift depends on which product you own. There are four types of domestic lifts, including traction home lifts, vacuum domestic lifts, hydraulic house lifts, and non-hydraulic home lifts.
Lift owners could be looking at paying out around 
£600
 to maintain a lift. However, costs can vary – you can expect to pay anything from 
£77
 through to 
£650.
 But this depends on where you live, which lift maintenance company you select, and the scope of what needs to be done.
A crucial part of being a lift owner is having lift checks carried out, so yours runs perfectly for as long as possible.
Maintenance calls cost 
£92 
while annual inspection certifications vary from
 £19
 right through to
 £115.

Find mobility experts your neighbours recommend  How to test home lift When carrying out a lift check, your lift maintenance provider will perform several checks including but not limited to:
Worm and other gearing
The components of the main drive system
Governors
Safety gear
Suspension ropes and chains
Overload detection devices
Hydraulics
Buffers, overspeed devices, and braking systems
Earth bonding, earthing, fuses, safety devices, and other electrical devices
Lift doors and landing together with the interlocks A guide to lift regulations UK You have a duty of care, whether your lift is used by employees in an office, restaurant, library, warehouse, or by residents, visitors, or the public. If you’re self-employed or an employer and offer lift equipment for use in a public environment or at work, you’re required to abide by the UK lift regulations.
These legal requirements offer a framework to make sure your lift is being used safely at all times and involve three key things:
Risk of manual handling
PUWER
LOLER
You can find more detailed information about this on  GOV.UK. FAQs How often should a lift be tested?
A lift should be tested:
Twice a year (once every six months) if it’s used to carry people.
Once annually if it’s used to carry loads or following an examination scheme.
Straight after any serious incident like failure or damage to the lift, extended periods of failure, or an exceptional change in performance conditions that’ll have an impact on the quality of its operation.
How long does a lift service take?
A typical lift service takes roughly three hours, although it can take as little as one hour. This depends on how old it is, what type it is, its condition, and where you live.
How do domestic lifts work?
A domestic lift is made up of the below components:
Lift car
Oil reservoir (with valve)
A ram
A motor (powers the pump)
A pump
The above components work in unison to produce a pressure-based system.
Once you press a hydraulic lift’s ‘up’ button, the:
Motor triggers the pump.
The pump starts pumping oil from the reservoir.
Oil transfers through the pipework beneath the lift car.
The pressure of the oil causes a piston or ram (located beneath the lift car) to push the lift car upwards at a steady pace.
To go down, the process works in the reverse order:
A valve opens to the oil reservoir, enabling oil to flow in at a steady speed.
Gravity propels both the ram and lift car downwards.
Oil’s pushed through the pipework into the oil reservoir at a steady pace.

How to get your house ready to sell,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/get-your-house-ready-for-sale/,Living Room,"How to get your house ready to sell

In This Blog: Common issues to fix before listing your house for sale How to get your house ready to sell – Checklist Kitchen and bathroom/s Home interior Home exterior Garden Do you need support moving out? Are you DIYing or playing it safe with professional support? FAQ Learn how to get your house ready to sell by using our checklist to prepare your home for potential buyers.
There’s something about the end of a year that makes us think about new beginnings. Sometimes we want to  redecorate a room  or  renovate an area of our house , and sometimes we want to move altogether and start afresh.
When it comes to the latter, data from  estatagent4me  tells us that the new year remains the best time to list our properties for a speedy sale, with homes listed in January selling the fastest.
So, if you want to capitalise on this time-sensitive window of opportunity, read on to make sure you have everything you need to make the 
new year, new home
 transition as painless as possible.

Find tradespeople recommended by your neighbours  Common issues to fix before listing your house for sale Before a buyer commits to buying your home, they’ll want to carry out a  survey  and check for any issues that might come up. If they find some, it could delay your sale and move, which is why it’s best to get these types of issues fixed sooner rather than later.
What are the common issues you should get fixed before listing?
So, what kind of issues commonly hold up house sales, and what areas should you focus on before putting your property on the market? Imagine you’re a buyer and you’re seeing a potential new home for the first time. What are the areas you’re most concerned with?
Our handy checklist below is going to walk you through the top 12 things to check before flipping your house. How to get your house ready to sell – Checklist Kitchen and bathroom/s Check for:
Leaks
Make sure your taps, faucets and drainage systems aren’t damaged. Your bathrooms and kitchen are more prone to leaks, so making sure these are in good working order is essential. The last thing you need is a build-up of mould. If you’re concerned,  hire a plumber  who can help you fix leaks in time for your first viewing.
Faulty cupboards
Water rot is an old friend to kitchen and bathroom cabinets, so make sure they’re in good condition before trying to sell your house. This includes fixing or replacing components such as hinges, handles and tracks.
Clogged showerheads and drains
Descale or replace your showerheads so potential buyers aren’t put off by rogue water sprays. You want them to be fully operational and clean to give a good first impression. Similarly, you’ll want to unclog and clean your drains so the water runs freely. You can be sure someone will run a tap while they consider buying your property!
Broken appliances
All white goods should work well and be thoroughly cleaned. Burnt on stains, an over-iced freezer and kettles that never stop boiling are all red flags.

Find tradespeople recommended by your neighbours  Home interior Check for:
Dents/cracks
Inspect
 your ceilings, floors and walls and repair any dents or cracks you find. You can use a filler from your local hardware store or repaint minor issues to help cover up imperfections and freshen up your home.
Faulty detectors
Safety should always come first, and you don’t want to be responsible for faulty smoke or carbon monoxide detectors. Make sure they’re the right model, less than ten years old, and in good working order for any new occupants.
Electrical hazards
Prevention is always better than cure, so why not hire an electrician to come and check your wiring to make sure everything is up to standard and meets current codes? Check out our  how to find a good local electrician  for more information. Home exterior Check for:
Door or window damage
Make sure all your doors and windows are dent free, in good working order, and weatherproof. Check handles, letterboxes, seals and paintwork, and  repair/replace  as required. The same goes for your garage door, If it’s electric, make sure it works and the mechanisms aren’t worn down or broken.
Our  garage door repair cost  will help you price up your project.
Roof damage
An unsightly roof equals an unsightly exterior, and it’s one of the first things a potential buyer sees. That’s why we recommend getting those tiles, chimneys and gutters checked and repaired before putting your house on the market. A roof in a poor condition might give the wrong impression, so  hire your local roofer  to fix any aesthetics. You’ll also need to check for water damage and rot.
Structural integrity
Check your house for any broken bricks or horizontal cracks, which might signal a potential structural issue. Other clues include sagging floors and cracks on interior walls.

Find tradespeople recommended by your neighbours  Garden Check for:
Broken fences/gates
Your gates and fences protect your garden, and when they’re in disrepair, they can make your entire outdoor space look run down. Consider sprucing them up by scrubbing them with a wire brush and giving them a fresh lick of primer and waterproof paint.
You can do it yourself or check out our  fence repair cost guide  to see how much your local fencer might set you back.
An untidy lawn
Is your garden in good condition? Could it do with a cutback and tidy? Sometimes all you need to do is mow and strim your grass and borders. However, if there are a lot of weeds or debris, we recommend having a good clear out so potential buyers aren’t put off by the potential labour. For example, if there’s a lot of debris, it might be worth  hiring a skip  to dispose of the waste efficiently. Do you need support moving out? Once you’ve checked the above common concerns and completed any repairs or replacements, it’s time to pack up and move into your new place. You can even use the same list to make sure the people selling you their property have completed their own checks and repairs.
We recommend organising your removal support well in advance. As our CEO, Mike Fairman said:
“Demand is particularly intense for tradespeople working in categories like Removals and Storage, with 81% more searches for these skilled workers compared to last year*.”
So, with tradespeople in short supply, why not  ask for some quotes  from your local removal professionals and get someone booked in asap?
*1 January – 31 July 2020 vs 1 January – 31 July 2021

Find tradespeople recommended by your neighbours  Are you DIYing or playing it safe with professional support? If you’re thinking of checking off our checklist with DIY, just think about the risks associated with bad repairs – not to mention the extra costs involved when it comes to correcting any mistakes. If you’re in any doubt about taking on a task, we highly recommend  hiring a local expert  your neighbours know and trust.
When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews. Even better, those reviews are from your neighbours, and checked by us to make sure they’re legitimate. Not only that, if you book one of our members for the job, we  guarantee their work,  giving you the extra peace of mind and security that you and your house is in safe hands. FAQ Which tradespeople should I work with to get my house ready to sell?
Most homeowners who are getting their house ready to sell will work with a plumber, electrician and handyperson. These three trades cover most jobs in your home and will be able to help improve your chances of selling up and moving into your dream home quickly and efficiently.
Any larger project, like a renovation, conversion or extension will require several tradespeople, including builders.

Cost to fit a thermostat to your hot water cylinder,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/fit-thermostat-hot-water-cylinder-cost/,"Bathroom, Kitchen, Loft","Cost to fit a thermostat to your hot water cylinder

In This Blog: What is a thermostat? How much does it cost to fit a thermostat to a hot water cylinder? How to fit a thermostat to a hot water cylinder Hot water cylinder thermostats quotes FAQs A hot water cylinder’s job is to provide a ready hot water supply for showers, washing and other household chores. The cylinder contains a lot of pre-heated water, so it’s all set for when you want it.
Fitting a hot water cylinder may seem simple to an expert, but for a DIYer it can be a nightmare. If you’re comfortable with the plumbing skills required to swap your existing thermostat for a new one, then by all means have a go yourself.
If you think a bigger job might be needed – such as  moving a hot water cylinder  – it’s best to seek the help of a competent professional. What is a thermostat? A thermostat senses when the pilot light is lit, triggering the gas control valve to emit gas.
If this part stops working, it can’t detect the flame, so the control valve will fail to produce gas. This means you’ll no longer be able to relight the pilot – or even the burner. Once your thermostat breaks, replacing it’s the best option.
Thinking of doing this yourself? Before working on the thermostat, make sure you turn off your gas connection and leave the water to cool down. How much does it cost to fit a thermostat to a hot water cylinder? To ensure the job’s done properly, we recommend hiring a plumber. In which case, it’ll cost closer to 
£110
 for installing a new thermostat to your hot water cylinder. The part itself can cost 
anything from £20
 on top of the installation cost.

Find heating engineers your neighbours recommend  How to fit a thermostat to a hot water cylinder Here’s how to fit a hot water cylinder thermostat yourself in 15 steps:
Switch off the power.
Remove the screw on the heating element’s access cover.
Pull off the cover.
Fold the insulation back to expose the thermostat.
Lift the tab on the top of the plastic shield and pull it off.
Loosen the screws, securing the wires to the thermostat.
Pull the wires out.
To release the thermostat, pull the tabs outwards at the top of the thermostat bracket.
Slide the thermostat up and remove it.
Place the new thermostat in the bracket, ensuring it fits firmly behind the tabs against the tank.
Reattach the wires to the new thermostat and tighten them firmly.
Reinstall the plastic shield over the thermostat and heating element.
Fold the insulation back in place.
Reinstall the heating element cover and screw.
Flip the house circuit breakers to the ‘on’ position. Hot water cylinder thermostats quotes If you’re trying to find out how much it’ll cost to fit a hot water cylinder, you may need to contact a hot water engineer in your local area. We advise contacting at least three such tradespeople for price estimates so you can get the best rate.
If you aren’t sure where to start, you could use our ‘ Request a quote ’ tool to make life easier. Just enter the details of the job and post it. Then, you’ll be contacted by hot water engineers local to you with their quotes. FAQs How do you change a thermostat on a hot water cylinder?
Fitting hot water cylinder thermostats is straightforward. You can do this by following the instructions mentioned above.
Where should a thermostat be placed on a hot water cylinder?
Typically, a thermostat is installed roughly one-third of the way up the hot water cylinder so it can measure the water temperature efficiently. If it drops under the desired temperature (normally 60-65°C), this triggers the boiler to come on.
To find out more about the types of boilers, what they are, and the types of heating controls available, take a look at our handy  boiler advice guide  – it’ll answer any of your boiler questions!
Does a hot water cylinder need a thermostat?
Yes, any hot water cylinder will need a thermostat because it helps keep your hot water at the appropriate temperature to avoid wasting energy keeping it warmer than needed.
How do I know if my cylinder thermostat is working?
Signs your hot water thermostat’s faulty include:
The cylinder or airing cupboard feel incredibly hot
Scorching water comes out of the hot water taps
Hot water comes out of the cold taps
You hear ‘bubbling’ or excessive noise coming from the hot water cylinder
You spot steam or moisture in the airing cupboard or roof space
You can test a thermostat’s working using a multimeter. A working thermostat should have a reading of zero or as near to zero as possible. So, if your thermostat doesn’t read anything at all, it means it’s broken and needs replacing.

How to reseal a bath in 3 easy steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/reseal-a-bath/,Bathroom,"How to reseal a bath in 3 easy steps

In This Blog: How to reseal a bath Best way to reseal a bath How to reseal a mouldy bath Easy way to reseal a bath FAQs You might think learning how to reseal a bath is pretty straightforward, but we’ve heard some horror stories that made writing this how-to guide a priority.
From hazardous mould to leaks that caused ceilings to fall through, we want to help you avoid the same fate. We’ve seen and dealt with it all. And as a result, it’s only right that we offer our top tips for a safe and waterproof finish.
Alternatively,  hire the local tradesperson  your neighbours recommend. You can read our  cost to reseal a bath UK guide  to find out how much a project like will cost How to reseal a bath If you’re reading this, it’s because you’ve decided to tackle the challenge yourself, which is admirable. Resealing your bath is a great way to give your bathroom a little refresh, and when done right, also protects it from mould, leaks and other potential issues.
So, without further ado, let’s get started.
What do I need to reseal a bath?
Tools you’ll need for the job include:
Silicone sealant
Applicator
Gloves
Glasses
Masking tape
Caulking gun
Safety knife

Hire a sealant expert your neighbours recommend  Best way to reseal a bath Once you’ve lined up your equipment and donned your safety equipment, it’s time to get started. Note that this method works for straight, curved or corner baths.
Step 1: Protect your edges with masking tape
Protect the bath enamel by using masking tape along the edges. This also lets you mark when you’re going to squeeze the silicone, giving it a clean line and smooth finish.
Top tip:
 Work backwards from the farthest corner and leave at least 3mm from the wall.
Step 2: Prepare and apply the sealant
Use your safety knife to cut the silicone top at a 45-degree angle. This allows you to have better control of the application. Next, attach the head/nozzle of the silicone before placing it in the caulking gun.
Now all you need to do is press down on the gun trigger to coax the silicone out. Get as close to the bath as possible and start from the farthest corner, working your way along the edge in a slow and steady way.
Top tip:
 Always start applying the sealant from the point farthest away from you to avoid disturbing any freshly laid sealant.
Step 3: Smooth and shape the sealant
Once you’ve applied the sealant, you’ll see you’re left with some ripples and bumps. So, now’s the time to dampen your sealant applicator and use it to smooth and shape the applied sealant. Try to do this at a 45-degree angle so the sealant dries in a way that allows maximum water runoff.
Now all that’s left to do is leave it for 24-hours before testing your handiwork!

Hire a sealant expert your neighbours recommend  How to reseal a mouldy bath The same steps apply when it comes to resealing a mouldy bath. However, before you dive right in, we recommend removing the mouldy sealant first.
To do this, follow these simple steps:
Use a safety knife to carefully cut away the mouldy sealant
Use a flat head screwdriver to scrape off as much of the old sealant as possible
Remove the remaining strands with white spirit using an old cloth and some elbow grease
Reseal your bath using the above simple steps Easy way to reseal a bath If the above method isn’t for you, then an alternative to using a caulking gin and silicone sealant is to use a flexible caulking strip instead. Essentially, it’s a self-adhesive that you can cut to size and fit in the gap between your tub and wall.

Hire a sealant expert your neighbours recommend  FAQs How often should you reseal a bath?
If you’re resealing your bath more than once every two years, there might be an issue with your sealant, application or bath itself. If that’s the case, it’s worth hiring a professional to check that everything is as it should be.
How much to reseal a bath (UK)?
Our  reseal bath cost guide  has everything you need to know about the costs and timeframes involved in resealing your bath. However, on average, it’s going to cost you around
 £85
 to get someone in to do this job for you.
How long does it take to reseal a bath?
A job like this can be completed in an afternoon, depending on your DIY skills or whether you’ve hired a professional.
Should I hire a professional?
Due to the risks associated with badly installed sealant, unless you’re confident in your DIY skills, we highly recommend
 hiring a local expert
 your neighbours know and trust. When using one of our professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their vetted reviews, which give you extra peace of mind.
Any tips to reseal a bath?
Make sure you thoroughly clean your bath before applying any sealant. Then, follow our steps above for a strong, smooth and professional finish.
Can I reseal part of a bath?
Absolutely. The trick is to cleanly cut away the sealant you don’t want and smooth down the new application with a damp sealant applicator to ensure a seamless fit.

How to remove wallpaper,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/remove-wallpaper/,Living Room,"How to remove wallpaper

In This Blog: How to remove wallpaper How to remove wallpaper with a steamer Best way to remove wallpaper and paint How to remove woodchip wallpaper How to remove mould from wallpaper How to remove old wallpaper FAQs Trends change, which means knowing how to remove wallpaper is an important skill to have. Removing wallpaper easily isn’t the only thing you need to worry about though, as you’ll also need to consider what method works best for your walls, whether that be a steam or chemical peel.
Don’t worry, we’ve got your back. In this guide, we’ll show you the easiest way to remove wallpaper so you can get your home ready for a refresh. How to remove wallpaper Before you get started, it’s time to prepare the area. This involves laying down dust sheets (polythene works best), placing masking tape on all your electrical sockets and moving out all your furniture (or pushing it all to the middle of your room).
Tools you’ll need for the job
Next, you’ll need to gather the following items:
Bin bags
Cloths/old rags and sponges
Rubber gloves
Stripping knife/scraper
Stool/ladder
Ruler
Broom
Bucket
Safety goggles and overalls
Electric steamer/chemical peel How to remove wallpaper with a steamer The best way to remove wallpaper is to use an electric steamer. It’s also an eco-friendly alternative to chemical peels, which is why it’s so popular. Follow our step-by-step guide to get started.
Step 1: Peel off the paper by hand first
To save you some time, try peeling off the wallpaper by hand first. This will be easier with some wallpaper brands than others.
Step 2: Fill up your steamer
Put on your safety equipment and prepare your steamer by filling it with water from a jug. While it’s heating up, make sure you’ve put down a level heatproof plate or wooden plank for it to sit on.
Note:
 Do not leave it unattended and never refill it without letting it cool down first.
Step 3: Place the steam plate on the wall
Once your steamer is ready to go, place the plate on the bottom edge of the wallpaper. Wait for 5-10 seconds until the paper dampens, which means the steam has penetrated enough to loosen its grip on the wall. Try not to leave it on too long as you risk damaging the plaster. (A pop = cracking plaster, which is a bad sign).
Work up the wall in sections (as heat rises), pulling off the paper as you go and discarding it in your bucket. You can use your stripping knife to make this process easier, but be careful to avoid chipping the plaster.
Continue this step until the entire wall is paper-free
Don’t trust your DIY skills? Well, you can trust one of our tradespeople. Why not  hire a local wallpaper removal expert  your neighbours recommend to help you out?
Step 4: Clean the wall for a smooth finish
To remove wallpaper paste residue, which is commonly leftover, follow these steps:
Use a stiff broom to brush the wall down
Carefully use your scraper to remove any leftover wallpaper pieces
Use a stripper solution to remove any residue
Clean the wall using warm water and a sponge
Leave to dry overnight

Hire your local wallpaper removal expert  Best way to remove wallpaper and paint If you want to know how to remove painted wallpaper, use a chemical stripper to remove wallpaper paste as well as the paper. It also removes the paint as the chemicals are strong enough to penetrate all three layers.
Put on your safety equipment
Prepare the solution as per the manufacturer’s instructions
Spray the solution onto the wall in sections and leave it to do its job
Keep your stripping knife flat as you use it to loosen the wallpaper, paint and residue
Repeat until your walls are clean
Top tip:
 Remember to regularly dispose of the wallpaper you’ve already removed to avoid is sticking to your dust sheets.
For non-chemical solutions, check out our  how to remove wallpaper paste  guide for some alternative methods. How to remove woodchip wallpaper The best way to remove woodchip wallpaper is to steam it and use your stripping knife at the same time. As woodchip often covers up old wallpaper or uneven walls, you’ll likely be faced with a few more layers of wallpaper to get through. How to remove mould from wallpaper If your wallpaper is covered in mould, this could mean there’s an underlying issue with dampness you need to address. However, if you’ve treated the underlying cause and don’t want to fork out for redecorating fees, the best way to get rid of mould is to brush down your walls using a hard-bristled brush. Then, apply a mould wash concentrate with a sponge, rubbing gently. Leave to dry overnight.
Alternatively, hire your local wallpaper expert to replace or repair your wallpaper. We have several vetted tradespeople who your neighbours trust and recommend.  Ask for a quote  to see what they can do for you. How to remove old wallpaper The above methods will work when it comes to removing old wallpaper. However, you may need to apply a mould removal solution as well (depending on the condition of your walls). FAQs What’s the cost to remove wallpaper and paint a room in the UK?

Nowadays, almost every company will rely on a computer network to access and share information across their organisation. With networks being such an important part of working life, it’s no surprise that engineers are highly valued for their ability to upgrade, maintain or troubleshoot systems.
That’s why going self-employed in the industry is such a great opportunity. Not only will you be able to profit from plenty of business, but you’ll also have the freedom to choose your working hours, specialisms and customers.
This guide covers everything you need to know, from equipment through to business planning, so you can start your own network engineering business and take that next step in your career.

Problem solving and troubleshooting skills for resolving network issues
Ability to lead and manage projects
Basic maths for managing your business’s financials and taxes
Teamwork, especially alongside a client’s in-house IT team
Interpersonal skills for building business relationships and providing a high standard of customer service
What equipment is required for network engineering?
Having the right equipment is key for completing jobs quickly and to a high standard. The following list covers the essential for most day-to-day work:

How can I start a network engineering business?
First, you must legally register your network engineering business with HMRC and choose a name. Try to make it short, catchy and relevant to your services. This is more likely to stick with potential clients – especially in a competitive market like IT.
You’ll also need to choose a recognised structure for your business. You can set up as a sole trader or as a company, and each has its own pros and cons. For instance, sole trading requires less paperwork but you’ll be personally responsible for any losses or debt your business incurs, whereas a limited company structure gives you more financial security but less privacy around your profit and earnings. Read our full guide  here  on the differences to help you make a decision.
Plan your network engineering service 
It’s important to have a clear idea of the type of you work you’ll be offering. Network engineers typically focus on delivering high-availability network infrastructure, but roles can overlap with computer network architects, security systems engineers or professionals within a client organisation. If you’re not quite sure what you want to specialise in yet, here are several network engineer business ideas you can use for inspiration:
Network performance consultancy – Analyse network performance and advise on updates or changes that should be made
Troubleshooting service – Monitor networks, identifying and resolving any issues that crop up
Network design and configuration – Put together network designs for businesses and install the equipment
Network security – Maintain firewalls, update virus protection software and perform data backups
Choose a target market 
As a network engineer you could expand your services across a huge range of different businesses. But to begin with, it’s advisable to focus on a couple of key sectors and develop your portfolio from there.
Healthcare and education have large estates requiring extensive networking, though they can be difficult markets to break into. Contracts in corporate offices, on the other hand, are very common and the technical challenges are often more straightforward. Be sure to consider the types of businesses in your local area before settling on a target market – research and planning is key.
Insuring your network engineering business
Network engineering is technical work that can involve the handling of valuable or sensitive data, so there’s always a small chance of something going wrong. That’s why it’s essential to protect you and your business with relevant insurance policies. Here are the main types you should consider: Professional indemnity insurance  – You’ll be dealing with numerous companies in your line of work, so this will cover your business if clients are unhappy with any work you’ve completed
Employers’ liability insurance – If you decide to take on employees, you’ll be legally required to have this cover in place
Cyber and data insurance – Your business centres around computer systems, so it’s essential for you to have protection against data breaches or hacks
How to run your network engineering business
While it’s not the most exciting thing about owning a business, bookkeeping is crucial. You’ll need to monitor your ingoings and outgoings to ensure you’re making profit at the end of the day. Bear in mind your expenditure may outweigh your revenue in the beginning due to start-up costs, which is perfectly normal. If this is a concern for you however, consider taking out a business loan to cover the initial costs of registration, equipment and insurance.
Don’t forget to manage your taxes as well. Different taxes apply to different business structures, so make sure you understand what taxes you need to be documenting. If you’re not sure, consider employing an accountant to help you file your taxes. Read our handy article  here  for more information on hiring accountant services.
Hiring a team
As your business grows, you may be faced with larger projects or an increased workload across different sites that you’ll need help with. Make sure your candidates have a solid CV with all the necessary skills and experience to be a competent network engineer. However, they may have learned ‘on the job’ and worked their way up, so it’s always best to meet potential colleagues in person. Attitude is massively important for a new business, so play close attention to their manner and approach. After all, they’ll be representing your business.
Marketing your network engineering business
Devising an effective marketing strategy will be key to securing more opportunities and building your business’s reputation. Seeing as you’ll be working directly with other organisations, it’s important to employ the right approaches for targeting these particular clients.  Signing up to Checkatrade  is a great way to raise your profile as it opens up your service to over three million monthly site users that could become your clients. You’ll also be able to interact with other members community, build trade relationships and gain valuable industry insight.
Social media is another useful marketing tool for your business. Setting up a profile gives you a platform to expand your audience, allowing you to interact with potential clients in your target market and drum up new business.
FAQs
Are network engineers in demand?
Most businesses are reliant on computer networks for both sharing and protecting valuable information, but maintaining these systems is very technical work. That’s why the skills of a network engineer are highly sought after for configuring and servicing networks. It is certainly a profession in demand, making it the perfect opportunity to start your own business.
How much can I earn as a self-employed network engineer?
Your earnings as a self-employed network engineer will vary depending on the demand for services and your rates, but here are some ballpark figures:
Network engineers with several years of experience earn on average £29,000 year.
Network engineers with a lot of experience under their belt earn around £40,000 a year.
As a network engineering business owner, you could potentially earn even more if you’re receiving a steady stream of opportunities. This will rely on you establishing a niche and marketing your business effectively.

Guide to low energy lighting,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/low-energy-lighting/,Living Room,"Guide to low energy lighting

In This Blog: What is low energy lighting? Common low energy lighting solutions Benefits of LED lighting FAQs When it comes to easy ways to make your home greener and save you money, low energy lighting is a no-brainer. Whether it’s for ceiling lights, uplighters, lamps or outdoor lighting, there are lots of low energy lighting solutions available.
The most popular low energy lighting options are LED lighting and compact fluorescent lighting. Keep reading to find out more about what they are and why you need them. What is low energy lighting? Simply put, low energy lighting works using low energy bulbs that use less electricity than standard lighting solutions. You’ll most likely have seen LED or compact fluorescent lighting, which – thanks to advances in modern technology – now give excellent lighting for a fraction of the running costs.
Switching to low energy lighting in your home might involve an initial outlay for low energy bulbs, which tend to cost more than standard bulbs, but they’ll last a lot longer. That means low energy lighting options will save you money both through using less energy on a daily basis (so your electricity bills will be lower) and also not needing to be replaced so often. It’s a win-win situation.
Want to know how else you can reduce the environmental impact of your home? Check out these other  green home ideas .

Find low energy lighting expert near you  Common low energy lighting solutions If you’re looking for low energy lighting solutions in the UK, the two most popular choices you have are Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs). Both offer excellent quality, cost-effective options for most general lighting needs.
LED lighting vs compact fluorescent lighting
Both LED and CFL lighting will save you a few bob every year, especially if you replace all of your standard lighting with low energy alternatives. Here are a few points to think about if you’re trying to decide between LEDs and CFLs:
LEDs are generally considered to be more efficient than CFLs, and will save you more money in the long run
Nowadays, both LEDs and CFLs are good options for replacing bulbs for most types of household lighting
CFL bulbs tend to be cheaper than LED bulbs
CFL bulbs are what most people understand to be energy-efficient light bulbs
If you need a very bright single bulb to light a room, a CFL is more suitable than an LED
CFL bulbs usually take a small amount of time to reach full brightness
Interested in LED lighting? Find out more about prices in our guide on  how much LED lights cost to run .
Low energy outdoor lighting
There are a number of low energy outdoor lighting options available so that your garden, patio, decking, paths and other outdoor spaces can benefit from energy-saving lights. You can even opt for solar-power outdoor lighting that will charge during the day using the sun’s rays, and then use the stored power to light up when it goes dark.
Low energy commercial lighting
Commercial lighting has historically been one of the worst culprits for energy-wasting, but all that is changing. Previously used incandescent or halogen light bulbs, which waste up to 95% of their electricity due to heat loss, are being replaced with low energy alternatives, like LEDs.
The EU has actually introduced regulations to phase out inefficient lighting in order to improve energy efficiency across Europe. This means that companies now have to replace their old energy-wasting bulbs with alternative low energy commercial lighting solutions.
Other low energy lighting options
If you’re ready to make the switch and replace your old inefficient light bulbs and lighting solutions, it’s good to know that you have lots of options for low energy lighting, including:
Low energy track lighting
Low energy high bay lighting
Low energy bathroom lighting
Low energy ceiling lighting
Low energy kitchen lighting
To find out more about exact costs, we recommend speaking to your local
 low energy lighting suppliers
 for their advice and quotes.

Find low energy lighting expert near you  Benefits of LED lighting Here are some of the reasons why you might want to start shopping for LED lighting for your home:
LEDs are the most energy-efficient bulbs on the market
They use 90% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs
LED lights can last up to 30 years
There’s no delay as LEDs give out light almost instantly
LED lighting works well in low temperatures (unlike CFLs) FAQs What is LED lighting?
LED lighting is a modern low energy lighting solution that was introduced to provide a more energy-efficient alternative to standard incandescent lights. LED light bulbs are generally more expensive than standard light bulbs and can cost up to £20 each for the brightest bulbs. That said, they’ll last a lot longer and will use a lot less energy – so you’ll save money in the long run.
How does LED lighting work?
LED lighting, or light-emitting diodes, produce light by using a semiconductor that emits light energy when an electrical current is passed through it. They work differently compared to standard incandescent light bulbs, which work by passing electricity through a thin wire filament.
How do compact fluorescent bulbs work?
When it comes to low energy lighting, compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs work differently to LED lighting. Instead of using a semiconductor, CFL bulbs pass energy through mercury vapour to create UV light that glows when it’s absorbed by a phosphor coating inside the bulb.

In This Blog: What is a septic tank drainage field? How much does a new septic drain field cost? How does a drainage field work? What’s the difference between a soakaway and a drainage field? Drainage field calculation Drainage field design Septic tank leach field sizes explained FAQs A septic tank drainage field is part of a septic system. It transports the wastewater back to the soil. After treatment and separation within the septic tank, water flows into a drainage field where it’ll organically filter through gravel, soil, and sand in a purification process before reaching the water table.
Often, the first indication of a leach field issue is the smell of sewage in your property or a swampy area in the garden.

A septic tank drainage field – also known as a leach drain or leach field – sits beneath the ground. It’s made up of a variety of perforated pipes which border the septic tank. It eliminates pollutants and contaminations from liquid once it makes its way into the septic tank. How much does a new septic drain field cost? Septic tank drainage field costs vary depending on its size and type. On average, you’ll pay about 
£3,700 
for the supply and installation of a 2,800 litre septic tank. For a larger septic tank (4,800 litres), you can expect to pay around 
£5,300 
for supply and installation.
The cost to install a septic drain field ranges from 
£3,000 – £7,000
.

Find a septic tank drainage field specialist  How does a drainage field work? The wastewater and waste from your property will flow into the septic tank, and thanks to the bacteria present, the water starts decomposing. The solid waste then falls to the foot of the septic tank and becomes sludge.
Fats, oils, grease, and other liquid waste floats on the top of the septic tank and the bacteria will break it down. The liquid waste then flows into the drainage field via underground pipework, whilst the solid waste stays at the foot of the septic tank where the bacteria continues breaking it down.
Finally, the liquid flows through the draining field’s pipework before running into the earth, where it’s naturally purified by the soil. What’s the difference between a soakaway and a drainage field? A rainwater soakaway is used to enable rainwater to infiltrate through the ground. Usually, it’s built by fitting soakaway crates within the earth to enable a substantial volume of water to come in and gradually empty away. You can only use a soakaway for surface water and rainwater.
A drainage field on the other hand is a loop of slotted pipes on and around a bed of gravel. It allows wastewater to run through the bed of gravel so that any bacteria will form there. This in turn removes contaminants from the water before it enters the ground. Drainage field calculation Apply your percolation test results to determine the floor area needed for your leach field. Use our drainage field calculator to work out the size of the field:
At
 (floor area) = 
p
 (number of occupants in your property) x 
Vp
 (percolation value in mm/secs) x 
0.25. Drainage field design It should be a minimum of 10 metres from any permeable drain or watercourse
It must be a minimum of 50 metres from a water abstraction point
It must be adequately far away from other leach fields, soakaways, or mounds
It should be a minimum of 15 metres from any construction
To protect abstracted drinking water, it shouldn’t be in an Environment Agency Source Protection Zone
If you do not own sufficient land to install a drainage field, consider a sewage treatment plant as an alternative to a septic tank and drainage field.
The design and installation of a drainage field should follow relevant British standards and building regulations Septic tank leach field sizes explained Leach fields should be at least 50 metres from a water abstraction point, 10 metres from a watercourse, and 15 metres from any construction.

Find a septic tank drainage field specialist  FAQs What is the purpose of a drain field?
A drain field is a covered, shallow pit made up of unsaturated soil. Without one, a septic tank would just overspill, produce overflow, and create a bad smell in your garden.
How do you build a drain field?
Building a drain field is best left to a drainage and sewer installation specialist. You can find out all the costs associated with  fitting a septic tank  in our expert guide. Be aware that you’ll need to have a  septic tank inspection  done, which involves a thorough check of the pipework and tank. This often requires  emptying the tank , too, with tradespeople using CCTV technology to inspect pipework.
If, however, you’re confident to do this yourself, here are a few pointers to bear in mind:
Choose your location (make sure it’s away from your property)
Get in touch with the authorities, as you may need a permit, and also, the site may need to be inspected before the work’s carried out
Ensure the soil’s right
Have the soil tested
Begin digging!

Roof vent cost,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/roof-vent-cost/,"Loft, Roof","Roof vent cost

In This Blog: Roof vent costs Roof vent installation costs Roof ridge vent installation cost Roof vent repair cost Roof vent replacement cost FAQs If you spot condensation in your loft (particularly during the colder months between November and February), your roof probably isn’t ventilated correctly. You also may have noticed water droplets (often called “roof sweating”) or even damp patches. Perhaps it smells musty or you’ve spied mould growing on boxes stored in your loft space.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Fitting roof vents stop loft spaces from becoming too warm or too cold and help prevent moisture build-up.
Enabling air circulation in your loft is just as vital as  boarding your loft  and insulating it properly. So, if condensation’s present in your loft space, installing roof vents will combat this as well as keeping the air circulating correctly for a more regulated temperature.
If you’re having a  new roof installed , it’s also worth mentioning to your roofer about having loft vents installed at the same time, as doing so will prevent issues further along the line. Roof vent costs Roof ventilation costs start at around 
£250 
for 20 circular/eaves vents – this would include fitting them in the front and back of your terraced or semi-detached house.
To fit four roof vent tiles, you’d be looking at a price of roughly 
£400,
 while fitting four ridge vents to a standard house would cost about 
£350.
There are three kinds of loft vents available, so we advise fitting a minimum of one type, but it’s best to fit two types, as all three would be a little too much. Roof vent installation costs A roofer will typically charge 
£150 – £250
 per day and, normally, they’ll work in pairs to carry out the task safely and efficiently.

Find a roofer your neighbours recommend  Roof ridge vent installation cost It costs roughly 
£650
 for a roofer to fit four roof ridge vents and 20 eaves vents to a two-storey semi-detached property, plus a day’s labour. The overall price will depend on the size, type, and the number of units you want fitting. Roof vent repair cost On average, a roofer will charge 
£650
 to repair four tiles and 20 eaves vents.
When selecting a roofing installer, a great place to start is searching on Checkatrade. Our members are reviewed by your neighbours and checked again by us to ensure the reviews are 100% genuine.
You can easily get three quotes from roofers near you using our  request a quote  feature. Simply enter information about your job and we’ll send it to three roofers near you. Roof vent replacement cost Most roofers will charge a flat rate for labour, which ranges between 
£250-£350 
per day, with vents costing well over 
£250
.
To be sure you’re hiring the right roofer, we advise comparing quotes. FAQs What kinds of roof vents are available?
There are three types of loft or roof vents to consider:
Ridge vents
 – positioned at the roof’s highest point (the ridge).
Tile vents
 – replace tiles mid-roof and work well with most roof tiles in the UK market.
Eaves/soffit vents 
– circular vents that are often fitted together with ridge vents for extra ventilation to enable airflow to the loft.
If you’re worried about the ventilation in your loft, it may be worth having  soffit vents  installed. These types of vents are fitted underneath the eaves of your roof to enable fresh air to pass into your loft.

LVT flooring cost guide,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/lvt-flooring-cost/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Conservatory, Kitchen, Living Room","LVT flooring cost guide

In This Blog: How much does LVT flooring cost in the UK? How much does LVT flooring cost to install in the UK? Cost of luxury vinyl flooring installed vs standard vinyl flooring FAQs Luxury vinyl tiles (LVT) look similar to real stone or wood and you can have numerous designs printed on them. The key difference is that they provide a whole raft of benefits over real stone or wood.
Produced in shapes of planks or tiles, LVT flooring is still a fairly new product – one of the fastest growing in the flooring market. Many people choose to install it in areas where water is present, such as kitchens or bathrooms. It’s often known as “luxury vinyl tiles” or “click vinyl”.
Want to know the costs of installing this durable, natural-looking flooring in your home? Here’s all you need to know when it comes to LVT flooring costs.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now How much does LVT flooring cost in the UK? The cost of LVT flooring is around 
£45
 per metre square. However, LVT flooring prices depend on the kind bought, material required for preparation, and labour. It’s more than possible to fit the flooring yourself, but most people opt for an experienced contractor so the task’s done properly and fast. When considering the average cost of luxury vinyl flooring, you’ll need to think about both.
Several installers will include the removal of your existing flooring in the price and will also throw in the cost of taking this away when discarding the old flooring. That said, this isn’t always the case, so double-check the quote they’ve provided includes the disposal and removal of the old flooring.
If not, you can normally pay an additional fee to have the flooring disposed of, which is around 
£120.
Alternatively, you could  hire a skip , which will cost around 
£165 – £425
 (depending on the size of the skip and your location)
. How much does LVT flooring cost to install in the UK? You can expect to pay from 
£180 to £300 
per day to have luxury vinyl flooring installed. However, this depends on a couple of things.
Firstly, you’ll probably get a reduced rate if you ask your local flooring installer to work on a few jobs, thus, giving them more work. Aside from this, the cost of flooring installation specialists varies, depending on where you live.
Installation costs consist of getting the surface prepared, so expect to pay between
 £2 – £13
 per square metre plus the cost of underlay, which is roughly 
£3 – £7
 per square metre. Labour prices range considerably depending on which kind of vinyl flooring you opt for and which type of surface the vinyl will be laid on.
You can expect to pay a professional floor installer an average of 
£200
 per day, while the price of preparing the surface will hinge on what floor type you have.
If you’re looking at having a herringbone pattern installed, this is more complex. For example, you’re looking at roughly 
£60 
per metre square for the fitting, a further 
£60
 per metre square for supplying high-end flooring, and 
£10
 per metre square for preparation. This gives a total cost of 
£130
 per metre square for herringbone installation. You may not mind paying the installation premium because it does look good!
With the price of herringbone in mind, a room of, say, 18 metres square would cost 
£2,340
, half of which would be labour, so approximately 
£1,200.
 The cost of 
£1,200
 equates to a tradesperson for four days, assuming their rate is 
£300
 per day.

Find recommended vinyl floor installers near you  Cost of luxury vinyl flooring installed vs standard vinyl flooring When it comes to the LVT fitting cost, it’s best to choose a local flooring specialist through Checkatrade. You can trust our recommendations, as the reviews are from your neighbours. And we check the reviews to make sure they’re genuine.
Standard kitchen vinyl costs vary, with the average  cost of installing vinyl flooring in a kitchen  being 
£530
 – based on a floor area of 18.5 square metres.
You’ll also have to bear in mind 
£200 – £400
 for the materials and installation needed for standard vinyl flooring in a medium-sized kitchen, for example. FAQs What’s the average cost of luxury vinyl flooring?
The average cost for luxury vinyl flooring is between 
£25 – £40 
per square metre if you opt for mid-end quality LVT. You’ll then pay for the surface preparation which is roughly 
£10
 per metre square plus about 
£7
 for the underlay. Finally, you’ll need to account for the installation, which is approximately 
£200.
Next, there’s a fee to have your old flooring removed, so expect to pay about
 £120 
for this.
You can request that your installer buys the materials for you, however, most people purchase the supplies themselves.
What kinds of LVT flooring is available?
Luxury vinyl tiles come in three kinds, including:
Stick down
 – stuck straight to the subfloor.
Locking system
 – the boards lock into each other on top of the underlay and is otherwise known as a “floating floor”.
Loose lay
 – laid over most subfloors with zero preparation and zero underlay.
All three are crafted from PVC, meaning they’re incredibly hard-wearing. With durable surfaces and totally waterproof, too, they’re ideal for fitting in any room you like!

Cost to check home lifts,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/check-home-lifts-cost/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Cost to check home lifts

In This Blog: Cost to check home lift How to test home lift A guide to lift regulations UK FAQs Maintaining your domestic lift or stairlift regularly is as important as regularly servicing your car to make sure it works properly. As well as the  cost of installing a home lift , you’ll have to factor in the costs of checking and testing it frequently to keep your domestic lift in tip-top condition.
Lift servicing may also stop other expensive repairs from being performed, thanks to early fault-finding before a more complex issue strikes.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Cost to check home lift The cost of checking your home lift depends on which product you own. There are four types of domestic lifts, including traction home lifts, vacuum domestic lifts, hydraulic house lifts, and non-hydraulic home lifts.
Lift owners could be looking at paying out around 
£600
 to maintain a lift. However, costs can vary – you can expect to pay anything from 
£77
 through to 
£650.
 But this depends on where you live, which lift maintenance company you select, and the scope of what needs to be done.
A crucial part of being a lift owner is having lift checks carried out, so yours runs perfectly for as long as possible.
Maintenance calls cost 
£92 
while annual inspection certifications vary from
 £19
 right through to
 £115.

Find mobility experts your neighbours recommend  How to test home lift When carrying out a lift check, your lift maintenance provider will perform several checks including but not limited to:
Worm and other gearing
The components of the main drive system
Governors
Safety gear
Suspension ropes and chains
Overload detection devices
Hydraulics
Buffers, overspeed devices, and braking systems
Earth bonding, earthing, fuses, safety devices, and other electrical devices
Lift doors and landing together with the interlocks A guide to lift regulations UK You have a duty of care, whether your lift is used by employees in an office, restaurant, library, warehouse, or by residents, visitors, or the public. If you’re self-employed or an employer and offer lift equipment for use in a public environment or at work, you’re required to abide by the UK lift regulations.
These legal requirements offer a framework to make sure your lift is being used safely at all times and involve three key things:
Risk of manual handling
PUWER
LOLER
You can find more detailed information about this on  GOV.UK. FAQs How often should a lift be tested?
A lift should be tested:
Twice a year (once every six months) if it’s used to carry people.
Once annually if it’s used to carry loads or following an examination scheme.
Straight after any serious incident like failure or damage to the lift, extended periods of failure, or an exceptional change in performance conditions that’ll have an impact on the quality of its operation.
How long does a lift service take?
A typical lift service takes roughly three hours, although it can take as little as one hour. This depends on how old it is, what type it is, its condition, and where you live.
How do domestic lifts work?
A domestic lift is made up of the below components:
Lift car
Oil reservoir (with valve)
A ram
A motor (powers the pump)
A pump
The above components work in unison to produce a pressure-based system.
Once you press a hydraulic lift’s ‘up’ button, the:
Motor triggers the pump.
The pump starts pumping oil from the reservoir.
Oil transfers through the pipework beneath the lift car.
The pressure of the oil causes a piston or ram (located beneath the lift car) to push the lift car upwards at a steady pace.
To go down, the process works in the reverse order:
A valve opens to the oil reservoir, enabling oil to flow in at a steady speed.
Gravity propels both the ram and lift car downwards.
Oil’s pushed through the pipework into the oil reservoir at a steady pace.

In This Blog: Common issues to fix before listing your house for sale How to get your house ready to sell – Checklist Kitchen and bathroom/s Home interior Home exterior Garden Do you need support moving out? Are you DIYing or playing it safe with professional support? FAQ Learn how to get your house ready to sell by using our checklist to prepare your home for potential buyers.
There’s something about the end of a year that makes us think about new beginnings. Sometimes we want to  redecorate a room  or  renovate an area of our house , and sometimes we want to move altogether and start afresh.
When it comes to the latter, data from  estatagent4me  tells us that the new year remains the best time to list our properties for a speedy sale, with homes listed in January selling the fastest.
So, if you want to capitalise on this time-sensitive window of opportunity, read on to make sure you have everything you need to make the 
new year, new home
 transition as painless as possible.

Find tradespeople recommended by your neighbours  Common issues to fix before listing your house for sale Before a buyer commits to buying your home, they’ll want to carry out a  survey  and check for any issues that might come up. If they find some, it could delay your sale and move, which is why it’s best to get these types of issues fixed sooner rather than later.
What are the common issues you should get fixed before listing?
So, what kind of issues commonly hold up house sales, and what areas should you focus on before putting your property on the market? Imagine you’re a buyer and you’re seeing a potential new home for the first time. What are the areas you’re most concerned with?
Our handy checklist below is going to walk you through the top 12 things to check before flipping your house. How to get your house ready to sell – Checklist Kitchen and bathroom/s Check for:
Leaks
Make sure your taps, faucets and drainage systems aren’t damaged. Your bathrooms and kitchen are more prone to leaks, so making sure these are in good working order is essential. The last thing you need is a build-up of mould. If you’re concerned,  hire a plumber  who can help you fix leaks in time for your first viewing.
Faulty cupboards
Water rot is an old friend to kitchen and bathroom cabinets, so make sure they’re in good condition before trying to sell your house. This includes fixing or replacing components such as hinges, handles and tracks.
Clogged showerheads and drains
Descale or replace your showerheads so potential buyers aren’t put off by rogue water sprays. You want them to be fully operational and clean to give a good first impression. Similarly, you’ll want to unclog and clean your drains so the water runs freely. You can be sure someone will run a tap while they consider buying your property!
Broken appliances
All white goods should work well and be thoroughly cleaned. Burnt on stains, an over-iced freezer and kettles that never stop boiling are all red flags.

Find tradespeople recommended by your neighbours  Home interior Check for:
Dents/cracks
Inspect
 your ceilings, floors and walls and repair any dents or cracks you find. You can use a filler from your local hardware store or repaint minor issues to help cover up imperfections and freshen up your home.
Faulty detectors
Safety should always come first, and you don’t want to be responsible for faulty smoke or carbon monoxide detectors. Make sure they’re the right model, less than ten years old, and in good working order for any new occupants.
Electrical hazards
Prevention is always better than cure, so why not hire an electrician to come and check your wiring to make sure everything is up to standard and meets current codes? Check out our  how to find a good local electrician  for more information. Home exterior Check for:
Door or window damage
Make sure all your doors and windows are dent free, in good working order, and weatherproof. Check handles, letterboxes, seals and paintwork, and  repair/replace  as required. The same goes for your garage door, If it’s electric, make sure it works and the mechanisms aren’t worn down or broken.
Our  garage door repair cost  will help you price up your project.
Roof damage
An unsightly roof equals an unsightly exterior, and it’s one of the first things a potential buyer sees. That’s why we recommend getting those tiles, chimneys and gutters checked and repaired before putting your house on the market. A roof in a poor condition might give the wrong impression, so  hire your local roofer  to fix any aesthetics. You’ll also need to check for water damage and rot.
Structural integrity
Check your house for any broken bricks or horizontal cracks, which might signal a potential structural issue. Other clues include sagging floors and cracks on interior walls.

Find tradespeople recommended by your neighbours  Garden Check for:
Broken fences/gates
Your gates and fences protect your garden, and when they’re in disrepair, they can make your entire outdoor space look run down. Consider sprucing them up by scrubbing them with a wire brush and giving them a fresh lick of primer and waterproof paint.
You can do it yourself or check out our  fence repair cost guide  to see how much your local fencer might set you back.
An untidy lawn
Is your garden in good condition? Could it do with a cutback and tidy? Sometimes all you need to do is mow and strim your grass and borders. However, if there are a lot of weeds or debris, we recommend having a good clear out so potential buyers aren’t put off by the potential labour. For example, if there’s a lot of debris, it might be worth  hiring a skip  to dispose of the waste efficiently. Do you need support moving out? Once you’ve checked the above common concerns and completed any repairs or replacements, it’s time to pack up and move into your new place. You can even use the same list to make sure the people selling you their property have completed their own checks and repairs.
We recommend organising your removal support well in advance. As our CEO, Mike Fairman said:
“Demand is particularly intense for tradespeople working in categories like Removals and Storage, with 81% more searches for these skilled workers compared to last year*.”
So, with tradespeople in short supply, why not  ask for some quotes  from your local removal professionals and get someone booked in asap?
*1 January – 31 July 2020 vs 1 January – 31 July 2021

Find tradespeople recommended by your neighbours  Are you DIYing or playing it safe with professional support? If you’re thinking of checking off our checklist with DIY, just think about the risks associated with bad repairs – not to mention the extra costs involved when it comes to correcting any mistakes. If you’re in any doubt about taking on a task, we highly recommend  hiring a local expert  your neighbours know and trust.
When you hire one of our trusted professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their customer reviews. Even better, those reviews are from your neighbours, and checked by us to make sure they’re legitimate. Not only that, if you book one of our members for the job, we  guarantee their work,  giving you the extra peace of mind and security that you and your house is in safe hands. FAQ Which tradespeople should I work with to get my house ready to sell?
Most homeowners who are getting their house ready to sell will work with a plumber, electrician and handyperson. These three trades cover most jobs in your home and will be able to help improve your chances of selling up and moving into your dream home quickly and efficiently.
Any larger project, like a renovation, conversion or extension will require several tradespeople, including builders.

Cost to fit a thermostat to your hot water cylinder,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/fit-thermostat-hot-water-cylinder-cost/,"Bathroom, Kitchen, Loft","Cost to fit a thermostat to your hot water cylinder

In This Blog: What is a thermostat? How much does it cost to fit a thermostat to a hot water cylinder? How to fit a thermostat to a hot water cylinder Hot water cylinder thermostats quotes FAQs A hot water cylinder’s job is to provide a ready hot water supply for showers, washing and other household chores. The cylinder contains a lot of pre-heated water, so it’s all set for when you want it.
Fitting a hot water cylinder may seem simple to an expert, but for a DIYer it can be a nightmare. If you’re comfortable with the plumbing skills required to swap your existing thermostat for a new one, then by all means have a go yourself.
If you think a bigger job might be needed – such as  moving a hot water cylinder  – it’s best to seek the help of a competent professional. What is a thermostat? A thermostat senses when the pilot light is lit, triggering the gas control valve to emit gas.
If this part stops working, it can’t detect the flame, so the control valve will fail to produce gas. This means you’ll no longer be able to relight the pilot – or even the burner. Once your thermostat breaks, replacing it’s the best option.
Thinking of doing this yourself? Before working on the thermostat, make sure you turn off your gas connection and leave the water to cool down. How much does it cost to fit a thermostat to a hot water cylinder? To ensure the job’s done properly, we recommend hiring a plumber. In which case, it’ll cost closer to 
£110
 for installing a new thermostat to your hot water cylinder. The part itself can cost 
anything from £20
 on top of the installation cost.

Find heating engineers your neighbours recommend  How to fit a thermostat to a hot water cylinder Here’s how to fit a hot water cylinder thermostat yourself in 15 steps:
Switch off the power.
Remove the screw on the heating element’s access cover.
Pull off the cover.
Fold the insulation back to expose the thermostat.
Lift the tab on the top of the plastic shield and pull it off.
Loosen the screws, securing the wires to the thermostat.
Pull the wires out.
To release the thermostat, pull the tabs outwards at the top of the thermostat bracket.
Slide the thermostat up and remove it.
Place the new thermostat in the bracket, ensuring it fits firmly behind the tabs against the tank.
Reattach the wires to the new thermostat and tighten them firmly.
Reinstall the plastic shield over the thermostat and heating element.
Fold the insulation back in place.
Reinstall the heating element cover and screw.
Flip the house circuit breakers to the ‘on’ position. Hot water cylinder thermostats quotes If you’re trying to find out how much it’ll cost to fit a hot water cylinder, you may need to contact a hot water engineer in your local area. We advise contacting at least three such tradespeople for price estimates so you can get the best rate.
If you aren’t sure where to start, you could use our ‘ Request a quote ’ tool to make life easier. Just enter the details of the job and post it. Then, you’ll be contacted by hot water engineers local to you with their quotes. FAQs How do you change a thermostat on a hot water cylinder?
Fitting hot water cylinder thermostats is straightforward. You can do this by following the instructions mentioned above.
Where should a thermostat be placed on a hot water cylinder?
Typically, a thermostat is installed roughly one-third of the way up the hot water cylinder so it can measure the water temperature efficiently. If it drops under the desired temperature (normally 60-65°C), this triggers the boiler to come on.
To find out more about the types of boilers, what they are, and the types of heating controls available, take a look at our handy  boiler advice guide  – it’ll answer any of your boiler questions!
Does a hot water cylinder need a thermostat?
Yes, any hot water cylinder will need a thermostat because it helps keep your hot water at the appropriate temperature to avoid wasting energy keeping it warmer than needed.
How do I know if my cylinder thermostat is working?
Signs your hot water thermostat’s faulty include:
The cylinder or airing cupboard feel incredibly hot
Scorching water comes out of the hot water taps
Hot water comes out of the cold taps
You hear ‘bubbling’ or excessive noise coming from the hot water cylinder
You spot steam or moisture in the airing cupboard or roof space
You can test a thermostat’s working using a multimeter. A working thermostat should have a reading of zero or as near to zero as possible. So, if your thermostat doesn’t read anything at all, it means it’s broken and needs replacing.

How to reseal a bath in 3 easy steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/reseal-a-bath/,Bathroom,"How to reseal a bath in 3 easy steps

In This Blog: How to reseal a bath Best way to reseal a bath How to reseal a mouldy bath Easy way to reseal a bath FAQs You might think learning how to reseal a bath is pretty straightforward, but we’ve heard some horror stories that made writing this how-to guide a priority.
From hazardous mould to leaks that caused ceilings to fall through, we want to help you avoid the same fate. We’ve seen and dealt with it all. And as a result, it’s only right that we offer our top tips for a safe and waterproof finish.
Alternatively,  hire the local tradesperson  your neighbours recommend. You can read our  cost to reseal a bath UK guide  to find out how much a project like will cost How to reseal a bath If you’re reading this, it’s because you’ve decided to tackle the challenge yourself, which is admirable. Resealing your bath is a great way to give your bathroom a little refresh, and when done right, also protects it from mould, leaks and other potential issues.
So, without further ado, let’s get started.
What do I need to reseal a bath?
Tools you’ll need for the job include:
Silicone sealant
Applicator
Gloves
Glasses
Masking tape
Caulking gun
Safety knife

Hire a sealant expert your neighbours recommend  Best way to reseal a bath Once you’ve lined up your equipment and donned your safety equipment, it’s time to get started. Note that this method works for straight, curved or corner baths.
Step 1: Protect your edges with masking tape
Protect the bath enamel by using masking tape along the edges. This also lets you mark when you’re going to squeeze the silicone, giving it a clean line and smooth finish.
Top tip:
 Work backwards from the farthest corner and leave at least 3mm from the wall.
Step 2: Prepare and apply the sealant
Use your safety knife to cut the silicone top at a 45-degree angle. This allows you to have better control of the application. Next, attach the head/nozzle of the silicone before placing it in the caulking gun.
Now all you need to do is press down on the gun trigger to coax the silicone out. Get as close to the bath as possible and start from the farthest corner, working your way along the edge in a slow and steady way.
Top tip:
 Always start applying the sealant from the point farthest away from you to avoid disturbing any freshly laid sealant.
Step 3: Smooth and shape the sealant
Once you’ve applied the sealant, you’ll see you’re left with some ripples and bumps. So, now’s the time to dampen your sealant applicator and use it to smooth and shape the applied sealant. Try to do this at a 45-degree angle so the sealant dries in a way that allows maximum water runoff.
Now all that’s left to do is leave it for 24-hours before testing your handiwork!

Hire a sealant expert your neighbours recommend  How to reseal a mouldy bath The same steps apply when it comes to resealing a mouldy bath. However, before you dive right in, we recommend removing the mouldy sealant first.
To do this, follow these simple steps:
Use a safety knife to carefully cut away the mouldy sealant
Use a flat head screwdriver to scrape off as much of the old sealant as possible
Remove the remaining strands with white spirit using an old cloth and some elbow grease
Reseal your bath using the above simple steps Easy way to reseal a bath If the above method isn’t for you, then an alternative to using a caulking gin and silicone sealant is to use a flexible caulking strip instead. Essentially, it’s a self-adhesive that you can cut to size and fit in the gap between your tub and wall.

Hire a sealant expert your neighbours recommend  FAQs How often should you reseal a bath?
If you’re resealing your bath more than once every two years, there might be an issue with your sealant, application or bath itself. If that’s the case, it’s worth hiring a professional to check that everything is as it should be.
How much to reseal a bath (UK)?
Our  reseal bath cost guide  has everything you need to know about the costs and timeframes involved in resealing your bath. However, on average, it’s going to cost you around
 £85
 to get someone in to do this job for you.
How long does it take to reseal a bath?
A job like this can be completed in an afternoon, depending on your DIY skills or whether you’ve hired a professional.
Should I hire a professional?
Due to the risks associated with badly installed sealant, unless you’re confident in your DIY skills, we highly recommend
 hiring a local expert
 your neighbours know and trust. When using one of our professionals, you’re able to see their profile and view their vetted reviews, which give you extra peace of mind.
Any tips to reseal a bath?
Make sure you thoroughly clean your bath before applying any sealant. Then, follow our steps above for a strong, smooth and professional finish.
Can I reseal part of a bath?
Absolutely. The trick is to cleanly cut away the sealant you don’t want and smooth down the new application with a damp sealant applicator to ensure a seamless fit.

How to remove wallpaper,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/remove-wallpaper/,Living Room,"How to remove wallpaper

In This Blog: How to remove wallpaper How to remove wallpaper with a steamer Best way to remove wallpaper and paint How to remove woodchip wallpaper How to remove mould from wallpaper How to remove old wallpaper FAQs Trends change, which means knowing how to remove wallpaper is an important skill to have. Removing wallpaper easily isn’t the only thing you need to worry about though, as you’ll also need to consider what method works best for your walls, whether that be a steam or chemical peel.
Don’t worry, we’ve got your back. In this guide, we’ll show you the easiest way to remove wallpaper so you can get your home ready for a refresh. How to remove wallpaper Before you get started, it’s time to prepare the area. This involves laying down dust sheets (polythene works best), placing masking tape on all your electrical sockets and moving out all your furniture (or pushing it all to the middle of your room).
Tools you’ll need for the job
Next, you’ll need to gather the following items:
Bin bags
Cloths/old rags and sponges
Rubber gloves
Stripping knife/scraper
Stool/ladder
Ruler
Broom
Bucket
Safety goggles and overalls
Electric steamer/chemical peel How to remove wallpaper with a steamer The best way to remove wallpaper is to use an electric steamer. It’s also an eco-friendly alternative to chemical peels, which is why it’s so popular. Follow our step-by-step guide to get started.
Step 1: Peel off the paper by hand first
To save you some time, try peeling off the wallpaper by hand first. This will be easier with some wallpaper brands than others.
Step 2: Fill up your steamer
Put on your safety equipment and prepare your steamer by filling it with water from a jug. While it’s heating up, make sure you’ve put down a level heatproof plate or wooden plank for it to sit on.
Note:
 Do not leave it unattended and never refill it without letting it cool down first.
Step 3: Place the steam plate on the wall
Once your steamer is ready to go, place the plate on the bottom edge of the wallpaper. Wait for 5-10 seconds until the paper dampens, which means the steam has penetrated enough to loosen its grip on the wall. Try not to leave it on too long as you risk damaging the plaster. (A pop = cracking plaster, which is a bad sign).
Work up the wall in sections (as heat rises), pulling off the paper as you go and discarding it in your bucket. You can use your stripping knife to make this process easier, but be careful to avoid chipping the plaster.
Continue this step until the entire wall is paper-free
Don’t trust your DIY skills? Well, you can trust one of our tradespeople. Why not  hire a local wallpaper removal expert  your neighbours recommend to help you out?
Step 4: Clean the wall for a smooth finish
To remove wallpaper paste residue, which is commonly leftover, follow these steps:
Use a stiff broom to brush the wall down
Carefully use your scraper to remove any leftover wallpaper pieces
Use a stripper solution to remove any residue
Clean the wall using warm water and a sponge
Leave to dry overnight

Hire your local wallpaper removal expert  Best way to remove wallpaper and paint If you want to know how to remove painted wallpaper, use a chemical stripper to remove wallpaper paste as well as the paper. It also removes the paint as the chemicals are strong enough to penetrate all three layers.
Put on your safety equipment
Prepare the solution as per the manufacturer’s instructions
Spray the solution onto the wall in sections and leave it to do its job
Keep your stripping knife flat as you use it to loosen the wallpaper, paint and residue
Repeat until your walls are clean
Top tip:
 Remember to regularly dispose of the wallpaper you’ve already removed to avoid is sticking to your dust sheets.
For non-chemical solutions, check out our  how to remove wallpaper paste  guide for some alternative methods. How to remove woodchip wallpaper The best way to remove woodchip wallpaper is to steam it and use your stripping knife at the same time. As woodchip often covers up old wallpaper or uneven walls, you’ll likely be faced with a few more layers of wallpaper to get through. How to remove mould from wallpaper If your wallpaper is covered in mould, this could mean there’s an underlying issue with dampness you need to address. However, if you’ve treated the underlying cause and don’t want to fork out for redecorating fees, the best way to get rid of mould is to brush down your walls using a hard-bristled brush. Then, apply a mould wash concentrate with a sponge, rubbing gently. Leave to dry overnight.
Alternatively, hire your local wallpaper expert to replace or repair your wallpaper. We have several vetted tradespeople who your neighbours trust and recommend.  Ask for a quote  to see what they can do for you. How to remove old wallpaper The above methods will work when it comes to removing old wallpaper. However, you may need to apply a mould removal solution as well (depending on the condition of your walls). FAQs What’s the cost to remove wallpaper and paint a room in the UK?

What is a handyperson?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/hiring-guides/handyman/,Living Room,"What is a handyperson?

In This Blog: What is a handyman? What is the average hourly rate for a handy professional? Benefits of hiring a handyperson Hire a local handyperson your neighbours recommend FAQs Most of us will have heard the term ‘handyman’ before, but it’s not always clear what they actually do. In this guide, we’re going to answer the question. We’ll look at the type of work they do and when you might want to hire one. What is a handyman? A handyperson is someone who carries out a variety of jobs that typically don’t require specialist qualifications to do – such as repairs and general home improvements. That’s not to say that they aren’t qualified professionals. Many of them have qualifications and/or accreditations in certain fields.
Some of the common jobs that a handyperson is hired for include:
Assembling furniture or equipment
TV mounting and installation
Changing light bulbs
Ensuring fixtures and fittings are in good working order
Clearing gutters
Painting and decorating
Maintaining property exterior through the different seasons
Minor plumbing and carpentry
Small repairs, such as putting up shelves or pictures
Safety measures, such as fitting smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors
Other odd jobs

Find handypeople your neighbours recommend  What is the average hourly rate for a handy professional? The nature of a handyman/woman’s work means that the hourly rate for a handy professional can vary, depending on the type of work you’re hiring them for and their individual experience.
So, what is the going hourly rate for a handyperson? Here are some average prices:
Flat pack furniture assembly – 
£70
Put up 8 basic shelves in living room – 
£200
Paint woodwork (skirting boards and door in 4m x 4m room) – 
£95
Picture & mirror hanging – 
£45
Put up curtain rail – 
£45
Minor electrical work – 
£60
Minor plumbing work – 
£60
To find out more about what is the hourly rate for a handyperson in the UK, check out our guide to  handyman prices . Benefits of hiring a handyperson There are a number of reasons why hiring a handyperson can be a good idea, especially for anyone who’s not great at DIY projects.
Here are some of the benefits to hiring a handyperson:
1. Save time and effort
The average handyperson has a wide range of skills that can come in very useful to save you the time and hassle of doing the job yourself. If you’re busy, or lacking the motivation to get those odd jobs done, hiring a handy professional will quickly get those tasks ticked off your to-do list.
2. They have the tools for the job
Generally speaking, a handy professional knows exactly which tools are needed for the job and will come equipped ready to carry out the work – saving you from having to shell out for tools you may not use very often (or ever again).
3. Get multiple jobs done at the same time
The fact that a handyperson covers a range of different jobs means that you can benefit from a single visit. For example, in one session they can put up shelves, put together some flat-pack furniture, and tidy up your front garden. Just think of the satisfaction of having all that done in one go.
4. Save money on small jobs
Very often you’ll have small jobs that need doing but don’t warrant the cost of a trained engineer or contractor. They can get those small tasks sorted for a lower cost than hiring a specialist to come out and do the same work.
5. They usually have lots of contacts
If you hire a handyperson for a job that turns out to need a specialist or someone more qualified, chances are they will know someone who’s right for the job. They deal with a range of jobs involving different trades on a daily basis, so they’ll be able to pass on recommendations to get the job done right.

Find handypeople your neighbours recommend  Hire a local handyperson your neighbours recommend Our handy (mind the pun!)  search  tool is a quick and easy way to find local handy professionals who come recommended by your neighbours and checked by us.
If you’re ready to get quotes for the work, use our  request a quote  feature, it makes the process of getting multiple quotes as quick and painless as possible.
Simply post details about the job and we’ll send it out to local painters and decorators in your area.  Give it a try now! FAQs What is a handyman allowed to do?
As a general rule, a handyperson can carry out small repairs and home improvements that don’t require qualified tradespeople and are often repairing or replacing fittings like-for-like. If the job you need doing involves major plumbing or electrical work, or involves a gas appliance, then you need to hire a qualified plumber, electrician or Gas Safe engineer.
What industry is a handyman in?
A handyman would usually be considered to be part of the ‘general home repair’ industry or ‘maintenance services’, which include handymen and general contractors.

How to remove wallpaper glue,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/remove-wallpaper-glue/,Living Room,"How to remove wallpaper glue

In This Blog: How to remove wallpaper glue How to remove stubborn wallpaper glue with vinegar How to remove wallpaper glue with fabric softener How to remove old wallpaper glue from plaster walls How to remove wallpaper glue from painted walls FAQs You’ve removed the dated wallpaper that once adorned your walls, and now you need to know how to remove the wallpaper glue that remains. Thankfully, there are several ways to do this, all of which we’re going to explain in this guide.
Getting rid of the sticky glue residue is important. This is because leaving it can trap nasty bacteria or mould beneath a fresh layer of paint or wallpaper. Also, as glue residue isn’t smooth, it causes lumps and bumps that make any new paint or wallpaper application unsightly.
It goes without saying that getting rid of glue residue is a labour-intensive job. So, why not  hire a painter or decorator  your neighbours recommend to do this for you? How to remove wallpaper glue If you’re set on completing this task yourself, the first thing to do is prepare the room. If you’ve already removed some wallpaper, you’ve likely moved your furniture already. So, do a quick check to make sure everything is covered with tarps to protect your floors and catch water. We also recommend covering your outlets and switches with painter’s tape so you don’t accidentally electrocute yourself.
Tools you’ll need for the job
Here’s what to use to remove wallpaper glue:
Liquid soap
Baking soda
White vinegar
Rubber gloves
Sponges and rags
Putty knife
Bucket
Bin bags
The next section is going to cover how to remove glue residue with vinegar.

Find a neighbourhood wallpaper removal expert  How to remove stubborn wallpaper glue with vinegar Step 1: Mix a DIY wallpaper paste remover
To make your paste, take your bucket and combine a tablespoon of baking soda, three tablespoons of liquid dish soap, 1 cup of vinegar and a gallon of hot water. Mix to form a paste.
Step 2: Apply wallpaper adhesive remover
Once your paste is ready, put on your gloves and use a damp sponge to apply the solution to the walls. Leave for a few minutes before removing with a dry rag. For more stubborn areas, use your putty knife instead.
Top tip:
 Work in smaller sections instead of the entire wall. Some areas will need soaking more than once.
Step 3: Clean your walls
After the glue is removed, clean down your walls and leave them to dry for 24 hours. Check they’re smooth and retreat any stubborn areas.
Still won’t budge?  Hire a professional  to apply a chemical stripper spray.

Find a neighbourhood wallpaper removal expert  How to remove wallpaper glue with fabric softener The best way to remove glue residue is debated. Some people prefer the fabric conditioner method because it smells better than the vinegar method. If you feel the same way, you’ll need the following:
Fabric softener
Spray bottle
Scraper
How to remove wallpaper glue residue from walls with fabric softener
Mix one part water to one part fabric softener in a spray bottle
Spray your walls in sections, fully saturating the area
Wait 15 minutes for the solution to get to work
The adhesive should now be loosened enough to scrape off with your scraper
Consider sanding down your walls before applying new paint or wallpaper How to remove old wallpaper glue from plaster walls If the above methods didn’t work (all of which are suitable for plaster walls), you can try some industrial wallpaper stripper, which you can buy online. Make sure you follow the manufacturers instructions closely to avoid any mishaps.
Alternatively,  hire a professional  your neighbours trust to make sure this job is completed efficiently and effectively. Check out our  wallpaper removal cost guide  to see how much it might set you back. How to remove wallpaper glue from painted walls In order to remove glue residue from painted walls, you’ll need to strip the current paint and treat it using one of our methods listed above. You’ll then need to repaint your walls for a smooth finish. FAQs What can I use to remove wallpaper glue?
There are various methods available. You can use one of our eco-friendly DIY solutions above, hire a professional, or use an industrial remover.

How to find a bricklayer,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/hiring-guides/find-bricklayer/,Garage,"How to find a bricklayer

In This Blog: 5 top tips to find the best bricklayer How do I choose a good bricklayer? 10 questions to ask to find a bricklayer How much does a good bricklayer cost? Get quotes from good bricklayers near you Bricklaying is an integral part of building work and bricklayers are literally laying the foundations for your building project. With that in mind, you want to be confident that you’re in good hands when you find a bricklayer to hire.
To help you separate the local cowboys from the good bricklayers in town, we’ve put together this guide. Keep this handy for when you need tips to find a bricklayer in your area and advice on how to choose a good bricklayer that you can rely on. 5 top tips to find the best bricklayer 1. Use our search
Our handy  search  is a quick and easy way to find good bricklayers who have been recommended by your neighbours and checked by us.

Find a bricklayer my neighbours recommend 
2. Ask for recommendations from friends and family
Your personal network of friends and family is a great way to get initial bricklayer recommendations that you can then research later. By getting suggestions from people you trust, you’ll have first-hand feedback on good bricklayers in your area. But you mustn’t forget to do your own research on them too.
Always check if they’re a Checkatrade member. If they are, then do book them through us – it means you can qualify for our guarantee.
3. Ask other reliable tradespeople
If you already know or you’ve worked with other professional tradespeople who worked well (such as electricians, carpenters or plasterers), chances are they’ll be able to recommend good bricklayers locally.
Reliable tradespeople like to work with other reliable tradespeople, so speak to the good tradespeople who’ve done a good job for you in the past and make use of their networks to find a bricklayer to hire.
Whenever they recommend a tradesperson, always check if they’re a Checkatrade member. You can easily see if they come recommended from other locals and see pictures from their recent projects. Even better, their work will be guaranteed by us (read about  our guarantee  for more information).
4. Contact building trade associations
Most reputable bricklayers will be a member of a trade association, such as the Association of Brickwork Contractors, the Guild of Bricklayers or the Federation of Master Builders. Belonging to an association like these is typically a sign of a good quality bricklayer with a professional attitude and a dedication to their work.
5. Ask local community groups
Many local communities have active groups where people in your local area can ask for and share recommendations. And that goes for finding a bricklayer near you.
You could upload a post asking for recommendations. You’ll often find that the bricklayers who are recommended by multiple people tend to be the good ones. But it’s still always worth checking if they’re decent through Checkatrade.
Do make sure to see if we’ve checked if they’re legitimate and if hundreds of your neighbours rate their work on our website. How do I choose a good bricklayer? Finding local bricklayers is one thing, but choosing a good bricklayer to hire is quite another. You want to make sure you’re hiring a bricklayer who is skilled, experienced, has a good working attitude and will work to a high professional standard.
Here are some of our tips to help you choose a good bricklayer:
Choose a bricklayer with lots of local experience
 doing work that is similar to what you’ll be hiring them to do.
Always read their reviews
 to see what previous customers are saying about the bricklayer – the odd negative review is OK, as long as the majority are very positive.
Ask for multiple quotes to compare
 to make sure you’re being quoted fair and competitive prices for the work.
Ask to view examples of their previous work
 in your area to see the quality of their bricklaying in person.
Meet with them in person
 before hiring them to get a feel for their attitude and how well you get on.
Always ask for customer references
 and follow up on them to get a good feel for how the bricklayer works and the level of service you can expect.

Find a bricklayer my neighbours recommend  10 questions to ask to find a bricklayer Before you hire a bricklayer, it’s a good idea to meet with them in person to discuss the work you need them to do. That way you can find out more about their experience and approach to their trade.
If you want to know how to find a bricklayer you can trust, ask potential candidates these questions:
How long have you been working as a bricklayer?
What qualifications and/or accreditations do you have?
Have you done many bricklaying projects like this before?
Can you show me examples of previous projects that you’ve worked on?
Do you have appropriate insurance, and can you provide valid certificates?
Could you provide me with references from previous customers for me to contact?
Do you offer a customer satisfaction guarantee?
How long will it take you to complete the work? And when can you start?
How much will it cost, and what are the payment terms?
What steps do you take to keep your work on schedule and within budget? How much does a good bricklayer cost? To help you plan your budget you can expect the average  bricklayer day rate  to cost around £150 – £200 per day, depending on the bricklayer, the type of work and the size of the job.
The  material cost for bricklaying  is roughly £800 per 1,000 bricks. The cost will vary depending on the type of brick, location, supply and demand, and the manufacturing process.

How to install an indoor hanging hammock chair,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/install-indoor-hanging-hammock-chair/,"Bedroom, Living Room","How to install an indoor hanging hammock chair

In This Blog: How to install an indoor hanging hammock chair How to hang a hammock indoors from the ceiling How to hang a hammock chair indoors without drilling FAQs So, you want to know how to install an indoor hanging hammock chair? Thankfully you’ve come to the right place. You can make this happen using:
A suspension set; or
A stand
A hanging chair is a lovely addition to most households, with its versatility and style suiting most aesthetics, especially Scandi, Japandi, boho, eco, and contemporary. Used as reading corners or for features, a hammock chair is perfect for those lazy days where you just want to sit tight and hang out.
Looking for decor inspiration? Check out what 
not
 to do with the  worst home décor fails of the last 50 years . How to install an indoor hanging hammock chair The following section is going to explain the two best ways to install an indoor hanging hammock chair. The first is going to focus on how to have a hammock indoors from the ceiling, and the second part is going to explain how to hang a hammock chair indoors without drilling.
So, before we get started, make sure you have the following items in your toolkit.
Tools you’ll need for the job
Pencil
Tape measure
Stud finder
Power drill
Ladder or step stool
The hanging chair
Hanging hardware (a kit from your local hardware store). It should include:

Screws
A mounting plate that can support over 150kg
Swivel bracket (allows the chair to swivel)
Spring extension (adjust the height of the chair)
Chain/rope that links onto the chair
Now you’re equipped, let’s get started.

Hire the handyman your neighbours recommend  How to hang a hammock indoors from the ceiling Step 1: Use your stud finder to find an ideal ceiling position
Once you’ve decided where you want your hammock chair, you need to make sure it’s doable. Hanging your chair on drywall is a costly accident waiting to happen, so please avoid doing this. If you’re not sure or you want extra peace of mind,  hire a professional .
To ensure a sturdy mount, use your stud finder to find a beam/joist. Once your stud finder picks up the beam, mark the edges with a pencil and double scan the area to make sure.
Top tip:
 You need to find the centre of the beam to avoid splitting the wood and making an unstable attachment. The stud finder should beep to tell you where the edges and centre of the beam/joist are. Triple check this step for greater peace of mind.
Step 2: Screw in the mounting plate
Once you’ve found the beam’s centre and edges, it’s time to screw in your mounting plate. Most are diamond-shaped, so be sure to screw in the plate so the long side aligns with the length of the beam.
You should notice resistance as your power drill tightens your screws. This means you’re creating a strong attachment, so don’t worry. Take it slowly and surely and avoid rushing this part. If you make a mistake, it’s difficult to rectify.
Step 3: Hang your chair
Once all four screws are secured and your mounting plate is looking sturdy and professional, it’s time to hang your chair! To do this, hook the extension spring on the ceiling mount and then hook your hanging chair onto that. (Follow the manufacturers instructions if you’re not sure). Afterwards, adjust the height to your liking and decorate to your taste!
Now all that’s left to do is sit down and hang out. How to hang a hammock chair indoors without drilling Now your know how to hang a hammock chair indoors using power tools, how do you hang a hammock chair indoors without drilling?
Sadly, you only have two options here:
You buy a hammock that comes with a stand; or
You hang it from existing posts or pillars.
The pros of buying a hammock that already comes with a stand are the lack of labour involved when it comes to installing it and the fact they involve little to no risk. However, they tend to take up more space, cost more, and therefore aren’t suitable for smaller rooms.

Hire the handyman your neighbours recommend  FAQs Can you hang a hammock chair from a wall?
As long as you locate a beam or joist using your stud finder and secure the attachments to those, hanging a hammock chair is doable, if not difficult. You will need to make sure your hammock chair’s wood spreader is at least 2 feet away from the surrounding walls. You can also hang them from concrete walls as they’re strong enough to withstand 150kgs.
Can wall studs support a hammock?
Although modern buildings tend to use wooden four-by-two to support the studs in their walls, some buildings opt for metal studs instead. You can drill into these, but they won’t be able able to fully support your hammock chair. Therefore, you risk injuring yourself and causing damage to your walls.
Should I hire a professional?
Despite our best efforts to teach you our tricks, there are a few risks worth considering. As mentioned, mistakes can damage your ceiling, walls, hanging chair, and you! So if you’re not 100% when it comes to your DIY skills,  hiring a professional  will give your peace of mind.
Not only that, but using one of our local tradespeople to install your hanging chair will save you time and energy better spent on other tasks. Why not  ask for some quotes  from our fully vetted experts? You can also check out their profile pages and see their previous customer reviews.

What does a locksmith do?,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/hiring-guides/locksmith/,Tag Not Found,"What does a locksmith do?

In This Blog: What is a locksmith? What are the different types of locksmith services? How to find a good local locksmith Questions you should ask a locksmith What qualifications should a locksmith have? If you find yourself locked out of your house, you’ve lost your car keys or you need to organise for a lock repair – who are you going to call? A locksmith. There are locksmiths all around the UK registered on  Checkatrade , with customer reviews that we’ve checked to make sure they’re real and reliable so you can be confident you’re hiring a trustworthy professional.
In this guide, we take a look at common locksmith services to answer the question: what does a locksmith do? We’ll also look at tips for finding a good local locksmith. What is a locksmith? A locksmith is a professional tradesperson who works with locks for a living, whether that be to fit locks, open locks, carry out lock repairs and other lock-related jobs. Many locksmiths will be trained in dealing with both domestic and commercial locks, and will either work from a shop or offer a mobile locksmith service – or in some cases, they’ll do both. What are the different types of locksmith services? Locksmiths are typically the first person to call if you’ve lost your car keys and don’t have access to your spare, or you’re locked out of your house and need their lockout service. However, locksmiths also carry out many other lock-related tasks. Popular locksmith services include:
Key cutting (including keys for garage door locks, window locks and padlocks)
Cutting, programming and repairing car keys
Fitting, opening and repairing safes
Installing access control systems
Door unlocking/lock open service
Emergency car opening
Lock repair service
Lock fitting
Emergency lock replacement
Advising on security options
Door unlocking services
Finding yourself locked out of your house can be a nightmare, and usually involves needing help immediately from a locked out of house locksmith. Fortunately, many local locksmiths will offer a house lockout service to get you emergency lock replacement and get you back indoors as quickly as possible.
It’s a good idea to confirm upfront how much they charge for their lockout service – especially if it’s out of standard business hours. Emergency callouts often come with an additional fee that you’ll need to factor in.

Find a trusted local locksmith  How to find a good local locksmith While there isn’t any legal requirement for a locksmith to have a license, looking out for locksmiths approved by the Master Locksmiths Association (MLA) is a good place to start. Choosing a local locksmith service over a national call centre is preferable.
Using our  online search  is a great way to find a professional locksmith service that you can rely on. Before a locksmith can join Checkatrade, we run 14 checks to check that they provide excellent quality service. All of our members are then rated by customers throughout their membership on their reliability and timekeeping, tidiness, courtesy and more so that you can browse reviews to find a trusted locksmith near you. Questions you should ask a locksmith Locksmiths in the UK don’t need to have any specific qualifications, and many learn their trade by becoming a trainee or apprentice first. However, knowing that your locksmith has received a certain level of formal training is always helpful in ensuring they can provide a high-quality service.
Are you insured?
Locksmiths will be handling some of your most prized possessions, like your car or your home. Making sure they’re insured gives you peace of mind in case there are any accidents.
Are you able to work with transponder chip keys?
Most modern car keys have these chips in them, but locksmiths need specialist training to work with them. If you need a new car key cut, make sure the locksmith is able to work with the type of key you have.
Can you give me an idea of the price?
For many types of locksmithing jobs, the locksmith should be able to give you an estimate over the phone. This is especially good to know in an emergency; the last thing you want is for a locksmith to arrive for you to find out it’s more expensive than you hoped! Be aware that unforeseen circumstances may affect the actual cost of the job, and it’s worth confirming the price with the locksmith once they’ve had the chance to properly examine the task. What qualifications should a locksmith have? While there are no requirements for locksmiths to have qualifications, and many learn their trade on the job, there are a number of qualifications and accreditations that locksmiths may hold.
Locksmiths who have completed a Master Locksmith Association apprenticeship will hold a Level 2 Certificate in Locksmithing, which is currently the only nationally recognised locksmithing qualification. However, there are specialist training courses available for certain types of car keys, UPVC locks, access control systems and restricted key systems.
If you need specialist locksmithing work carried out, ask whether the locksmith has experience in carrying out similar work, and have a look at their reviews to see what their past customers have to say.

Carpet tile installation cost guide,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/carpet-tile-installation-cost/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Carpet tile installation cost guide

What’s the cost of carpet squares? What is the carpet tile installation price? FAQs Carpet tiles are often chosen as a floor covering because of their durability and appearance. Available in a range of colours of varying quality, the underlay is already part of the carpet tile. And they’re generally stuck down using adhesive or come as a peel and stick tile.
The real edge carpet tiles have over traditional wall-to-wall carpeting is that it’s effortless to replace tiles when they become damaged or worn rather than  replacing your existing carpet  with a whole new one. In which case, carpet tiles are great for children’s bedrooms, in rooms that pets spend a lot of time in, and in heavy traffic rooms.
What’s more, carpet tiles require zero adhesives, making them ideal to place in rooms that need a quick floor cover-up. Even better, there’s absolutely no installation mess.

Repair inspection chamber cost guide,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/repair-inspection-chamber-cost/,"Conservatory, Garden","Repair inspection chamber cost guide

In This Blog: Cost to repair inspection chamber Cost to replace inspection chamber cover How to get a quote to replace an inspection chamber FAQs An inspection chamber – otherwise known as a manhole or drain cover – is an access point to pipework underground that enables the removal and maintenance of blockages. If you’re fitting any kind of drainage underground, you’ll likely need to fit an inspection chamber.
Essentially, an inspection chamber is a manhole. The main difference between the two is that an inspection chamber allows cameras and equipment in, while manholes are purely for physical entry and inspection.
Below, we’ll take you through how much it costs to repair an inspection chamber.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Cost to repair inspection chamber It costs

per manhole on average. The typical labour costs for a day to install will be around 
£450
. Cost to replace inspection chamber cover For the chamber cover, you can expect to pay around 
£50 – £80
 for the part. Then by hiring a local drainage repair specialist, the labour time will cost closer to 
£680
 in total. How to get a quote to replace an inspection chamber You can get multiple quotes from local drainage repair engineers. We’ve made things simple with our  request a quote  feature. All you have to do is fill in the form then we’ll send it out to three drainage installers near you.

Find drainage experts your neighbours recommend  FAQs Can an inspection chamber be moved?
Yes, if the inspection chamber belongs to you, then it’s possible to move it. However, it’s vital to check it doesn’t belong to a sewer company.
How do I install a new inspection chamber myself?
To install a new inspection chamber, you’ll need the following materials:
Hack saw
Spirit level
Tape measure
File
Goggles
Mini digger/spade
Silicone spray
Workbench
Marker pen
Hi-vis jacket
Pea shingle
Hard hat
Concrete slab for solid support

Find drainage experts your neighbours recommend 
Step by step to install a new inspection chamber
Dig your trench to the building regulations and British Standards.
Drop in pea shingle to make sure the pipe’s supported properly – this creates the pipe lead.
Make sure you know where all the key fittings will go.
Check the inspection chamber’s aligned to ensure the water flow’s sustained across the main outlet.
If installing into a perpendicular soil ventilation pipe, position a concrete slab under the long radius west bend for support.
Calculate and cut the strip of the pipe that links the rest bend to the first inspection chamber.
It’s important the cut lengths of pipe are bevelled to approximately a 45-degree angle.
Use gel silicone lubricant or a spray to affix the first segment of pipe on the seal to aid fitting.
For the remaining fittings, repeat the previous technique.
You can add bottle gullies, traps, and other available fittings to the system.
Ventilation pipes and soil fit directly into the long radius bend.
You can use a universal rainwater adaptor to join rainwater downpipes to the system.
You can add numerous access chambers up to a 600mm height.
Big inspection chambers can reach a maximum of 1.2m high using the regular 450mm frame and lid.
A maximum of three metres with a 350mm reduced access frame and lid.
Finally, add rises to the required depth.
Backfill using pea shingle up to the pipework’s crown.
Backfill with the dug-out soil.
How do I remove my inspection chamber cover?
Use a screwdriver and scrape around the edge.
To loosen, gently tap around it using a hammer.
If you still can’t remove it, tap the cover with a piece of wood (the vibrations will help free it).
Once loose, use a screwdriver to lift it just a little and insert a spade underneath one edge until you can lift it.
You can use a special key to take off the cover, or even a piece of bent steel or a hook.
If the cover’s fitted with a screw-type, use penetration oil before trying to use a spanner or wrench on them.
Can I cover an inspection chamber?
If you’re planning to cover your inspection cover with a building such as a conservatory, for example, you must make sure you have permission to do so.
If your property was constructed after 1939, it probably has a private sewer system. In other words, your regional water authority doesn’t own it. In most cases, though, you probably need to shift the chamber or have the pipes diverted. You may also need to adjust the building plans to maintain access to the current inspection chamber.

Tammie Houston

You made a great point when you said that window cleaners can do a better job than I can since they have the necessary tools and training to clean windows better than I. My mother's windows have all grown grimy with age and I don't think that I could effectively wipe the muck from it on my own. Hopefully, I can find a good window washer that can identify what exactly they are and use the right tools for the job without damaging the windows.

Cheapest way to add value to your home,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/cheapest-way-add-value-home/,Living Room,"Cheapest way to add value to your home

In This Blog: What is the cheapest way to add value to your home? Our top 10 inexpensive ways to increase your home value Other ways to increase your home value If you’re planning to sell your home in the near future, it’s totally understandable that you’d want to get the most money for it that you can. And, thankfully, there are plenty of inexpensive ways to increase your home’s value without breaking the bank.
In this guide, we look at the cheapest ways to add value to your home so that you can make the most of your property and boost its sale price. What is the cheapest way to add value to your home? It can be surprisingly quick and easy to make changes to your home and add value, it just requires a little effort to spruce things up and make obvious repairs. What you need to remember is that first impressions count, so you want your home to look and feel fresh, clean and homely.
The key is to create a home that potential buyers can see themselves living in, without having to immediately do lots of odd jobs.
Some of the cheapest ways to add value to your home include:
Decorating
Fixing broken fixtures and fittings
Decluttering the main rooms
Tidying up the garden
Smartening up the driveway
These cheaper alternatives may not add as much value as the bigger projects, but they can have an impact on anyone looking to buy your property.

Find handypeople your neighbours recommend  Our top 10 inexpensive ways to increase your home value Here’s our list of the best inexpensive home upgrades that add value to your property:
1. Freshen up the paintwork
A fresh lick of paint can do wonders for a home, making rooms look new and adding value at the same time. Stick to light, neutral colours to appeal to the masses – avoid any striking or dark shades, as they tend to be a turn-off for buyers.
2. Replace door handles
Updating door and cupboard handles is one of the quickest cheap fixes to increase home value.
It might sound like a very subtle change, but you’d be surprised at how many buyers will notice small details like handles and be swayed by them.
3. Make the most of your front door
As we’ve said before, first impressions are super important when selling your home and your front door can help or hinder a sale. If your front door is looking tired, dented or damaged, do yourself a favour and replace it with a shiny new door to boost curb appeal.
4. Fix up shabby fencing
If your home has outdoor space then repairing or replacing any fencing is a relatively inexpensive way to increase home value. Buyers like to see a clear and well-maintained border of the property and they’ll want to feel like it’s secure. So, if you have any broken or rotting fence panels, get them sorted to add value to your home.
5. Give your lighting some love
When it comes to inexpensive home upgrades that add value, never underestimate the power of a good light fixture. Lighting and light fittings can really add style and character to a home – just make sure they’re in keeping with the rest of the property.
Many buyers these days are conscious of energy efficiency, which means swapping to LED bulbs could be a smart move.
6. Get your grouting sorted
Dirty grouting in kitchens and bathrooms is a detail that’s often missed if you’ve been living in your home for a while, but it’s often one of the first things potential buyers will notice. And the good news is, it’s pretty quick, cheap and easy to remove. Worst case scenario, you need to pay for regrouting – but it certainly counts as one of those cheap fixes to increase home value.

Find handypeople your neighbours recommend 
7. Spruce up your outside space
If you have a garden or other outside space, doing a bit of tidying is one of the cheapest ways to add value to your home. Mow the lawn, cut back any overgrown plants and get rid of any weeds to give your garden a cheap but important facelift to increase the value of your home.
8. Clean your carpets
If you don’t want to spend money replacing the carpets in your home, at the very least you should give your existing carpets a thorough clean – ideally by hiring a professional carpet cleaner. Not only will a professional clean get your carpets looking brighter and cleaner, it will also leave your home smelling fresher.
9. Invest in home security
Motion sensors, flood lights and strong door locks are all features that can help add value to your home for a relatively low cost. If buyers feel that your home is safe and secure then they’re much more likely to want to buy it
10. Tap into the value of taps
Upgrading old or rusty taps to fresh, modern taps is another of the cheapest ways to increase home value. They’re another of those small details that doesn’t seem like much but can have a big impact on the overall look and feel of your home, and add value to it. Other ways to increase your home value If you do have the budget to make bigger changes to your home, rather than just looking for the cheapest ways to increase home value, we’ve put together some other guides that you might find useful: How to add value to your home  – with renovations, conversions and new builds How much value does an extension add? Does a garage conversion add value to your home? How much value does a new kitchen add to your home? Does an annexe add value to a house? How much value does a conservatory add to your home?

Best driveway materials,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/best-driveway-materials/,Garden,"Best driveway materials

In This Blog: What is the best driveway material? 5 popular types of driveway surface materials How much does a new driveway cost? FAQs Choosing the best driveway material for your home is a big decision. Not only has it got to look good but it will also need to stand the test of time. There are lots of options out there, each with their own set of pros and cons depending on your particular driveway.
For example, the best material for sloping driveways won’t necessarily be the same as the best material for a flat surface. Keep reading to find out more. What is the best driveway material? It’s difficult to pick out one single ‘best driveway material’ as it depends on your home, the current driveway surface and your personal taste. But don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. We’re going to look at the most popular driveway materials to help you decide which is the best driveway material for you and your home.
Factors to consider for the best driveways
The best materials for driveways will vary depending on a number of factors, including:
Size of the driveway
Existing driveway surfaces
The angle of any slope
The amount of use the driveway will get
Budget

Find a driveway expert my neighbours recommend  5 popular types of driveway surface materials When you start talking about types of driveways, driveways surfaces and best driveway materials, you’ll come up with a pretty common list. Below are the most popular driveway materials for the best driveways in the UK.
1. Asphalt (or Tarmac) driveways
Asphalt driveways are an extremely popular choice with homeowners in the UK – otherwise known to many as Tarmac. Some of the reasons for its popularity include:
Asphalt is often one of the cheaper drive materials
It has excellent longevity of more than 20 years
The seal applied on top of asphalt driveways makes it even more hard-wearing and durable
Asphalt looks good with its sleek finish
That said, there are some issues with asphalt – mainly when it heats up. During hot summer months, asphalt driveways can get sticky, show tyre marks and sometimes even alter the shape of the asphalt. Thankfully extreme heat isn’t something we often have to worry about in the UK.
2. Gravel driveways
Gravel is one of the best driveway materials for homeowners with a limited budget and for those who are more security conscious. Some of the benefits of gravel as a driveway material are:
Gravel is quick and easy to install
There are a lot of colour and style options for gravel stones to match your home’s style
It’s cheaper than most other driveway materials
The crunch of the gravel stones underfoot can act as a deterrent to opportunist thieves
On the downside, gravel driveways require a lot of maintenance to deal with moving stones, dirt, weeds and the fact that, over time, it can quickly look messy with visible ruts and sinkholes.
3. Block paving driveways
Block paving is one of the driveway materials that has become very popular in recent years, with many homeowners in the UK opting for block paved driveways to create a beautiful feature for their homes. Some of the big advantages of block paving driveways include:
Block paving is generally considered one of the top materials for creating the best looking driveways
There’s a huge range of blocks available in different shapes, sizes, colours and patterns
Block paving creates a very hard-wearing driveway surface (if installed correctly)
Individual blocks are easy to replace, which helps keep maintenance costs down
The main drawback of block paving as a material for driveway surfaces is the cost, as it tends to be one of the most expensive options available. It’s also one of the most complicated driveway materials to install and requires intricate block laying to create paving patterns.
4. Concrete driveways
If you’re looking for a super low maintenance option for your driveway surface, then concrete could be the best driveway material for you. Concrete driveways aren’t usually considered to be the most visually impressive driveway materials, but that doesn’t mean they can’t have a certain charm. The benefits include:
Concrete is very low maintenance
It’s an excellent choice for homes that have an industrial style to them
Concrete driveways have good temperature regulation which stops them from getting too hot in the summer
There are now various colour options for concrete driveways
Although concrete is a low maintenance driveway material, over time you may see cracks appearing and to repair cracks you would need to remove the entire driveway and install new concrete. Oil stains can also be an issue for concrete driveways.
5. Resin driveways
Last but certainly not least, resin earns its place on our list of best driveway materials thanks to its visual appeal and the fact that it’s a very hard-wearing driveway surface. The main advantages of having a resin driveway include:
Resin creates a beautiful finish that looks slick and will boost curb appeal
You can choose between
 permeable resin bound
 or impermeable resin bonded
There’s a wide range of colour options available to complement your home
Resin tends to be a fairly inexpensive driveway material, compared to some of the other options
It’s relatively low maintenance and easy to keep clean
If you go for a resin driveway, make sure you hire a  reputable company  with lots of experience installing resin to ensure it’s done properly. How much does a new driveway cost? The cost of a new driveway will depend on the size of your driveway, the type of driveway material you choose, and the complexity of the installation. Here are some average driveway costs you could expect to pay: Asphalt  –
 £50 – £100 per m
2 Brick  – 
£32 – £100 per m
2
Concrete – 
£75 – £85 per m
2 Gravel  – 
£50 – £70 per m
2 Resin  – 
£80 – £210 per m
2
To find out more about prices, check out our guides to  driveway resurfacing costs  and  driveway paving costs . FAQs What’s the best material for sloping driveways?
Out of all the driveway materials, resin is often considered the best material for sloping driveways. If you have a sloping driveway, it’s best to avoid materials like gravel and stones, which can easily roll down the slope and collect at the bottom. You also need to consider the slippery nature of some surfaces when wet, like concrete.
What type of gravel is best for driveways?
There are a number of different types of gravel available, but the best types of gravel for driveways are shingle and pea gravel – mainly due to them being excellent options for surfacing, drainage and affordability.
What is the best paint for concrete driveways?
There are typically three types of paint that are most suitable for concrete driveways: epoxy concrete paint, polyurethane paint, and polyurea paint.
What is the best concrete sealer for driveways?
When choosing a concrete sealer for a driveway, you want to make sure it’s 100% UV fade resistant, has anti-fungicidal properties, is made using premium quality resins, and ideally one that comes with a quality guarantee.

Property maintenance costs for landlords,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/property-maintenance-costs-landlords/,Living Room,"Property maintenance costs for landlords

In This Blog: What are the main landlord maintenance costs? 10 common property maintenance costs for landlords How much are landlord costs? Landlord repairs responsibilities Becoming a landlord can be a great source of income or a smart way to get someone else to pay off your mortgage. But many homeowners forget to consider the property maintenance costs for landlords – which can quickly add up if you’re not careful.
In this guide, we look at landlord maintenance costs so that you can plan your finances and avoid underestimating the cost of maintenance and repairs for a rental property. What are the main landlord maintenance costs? The world of buying a property to let out comes with a number of landlord costs that you’ll need to pay attention to. Especially if you want to make sure you’re covering your costs and making a profit – or at least breaking even.
The amounts you have to pay will vary for a number of reasons. The biggest effect will be where the property is located. It’s best for you to put together a list of all the various costs into a spreadsheet so you can plan all your property-related spending. 10 common property maintenance costs for landlords Here are 
10 property maintenance costs for landlords
 that you’ll want to do your homework on before signing up to rent out your property.
1. Buy-to-let mortgage fees and payments
Buy-to-let mortgages have higher rates of interest than a regular mortgage and often higher fees too. Plus, you will most likely need a bigger deposit than if you were buying a house to live in yourself.
It’s important to shop around for the best deal and work out exactly what your initial outlay and ongoing payments will be to secure a buy-to-let mortgage for the property.
2. Legal and admin costs
There are a few costs that might seem small on their own but they can soon add up. Costs such as registering with a deposit protection scheme, obtaining an energy certificate for the property, tenancy agreements, and setting up utilities such as water and paying ground rent.
3. Landlord insurance
You’ll want to make sure you have specific landlord insurance, which is different to a standard home insurance policy, to cover you as a landlord. At the very least you’ll need buildings cover but, if you’re renting out a furnished property, you’ll want the right level of content insurance too.
You can also protect yourself against loss of rent, providing alternative accommodation if the property becomes inhabitable, and damage caused by tenants – all sensible cover to consider as a landlord.
4. Decorating
As a general rule, you should plan landlord maintenance costs to redecorate your rental property every three years.
You’ll also need to make sure it’s cleaned and freshened up each time you change tenants – which would involve landlord costs for paint and a decorator (if you’re not planning on doing the painting yourself), roughly once a year.
5. Maintenance and repairs
The cost of maintenance and repairs to a rental property will vary massively, depending on the property and – most importantly – your tenants. You’ll need to set aside a budget for maintenance to cover things like the heating system, roof, white goods, flooring, plumbing and electrics.
It’s hard to know exactly how much maintenance and repairs will cost you as a landlord, but a rough guide is an annual spend of 1% of the property’s total value for repairs each year. For example, if you have a property worth £250,000 then you should budget roughly £2,500 per year for the maintenance and repairs to your rental property.
Did you know – it’s about to become easier for you to repair your property’s appliances. Find out more about the new  UK right to repair laws .

6. Letting agency fees
If you plan on using a letting agency to rent out your property, then you’ll most likely need to pay somewhere in the region of 10-20% of the monthly rent income if you want them to manage the property for you. On the other hand, if you just want them to find a tenant and then you’ll manage it yourself then you’ll usually only have to pay a one-off fee.
Speak to local letting agents first to see what services they offer and how much they charge, so that you can find the best deal for you and your rental property.
7. Health & safety measures
You’ll need a gas safety certificate for any property you’re renting out, which is usually around £60 per gas appliance – and you’ll need them issued every year to comply with the law. You’ll also need an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for rental properties, at a cost of £60 – £120 for registration (which is valid for 5 years).
8. Taxes
If you’re renting out a property, you’ll need to declare any profits from the rental income. To calculate the profits you can deduct allowable expenses, such as maintenance and repair costs, council tax, utility bills, insurance, letting agent fees, and service costs (including the cost of cleaners and gardeners).
You can’t deduct the cost of your mortgage repayments, but you will receive a 20% tax relief on all of your mortgage interest payments. So, if your mortgage interest payments total £10,000, you’ll get £2,000 in tax relief.
9. Finding tenants
To start earning rental income you first need tenants. A letting agent will charge a finder’s fee to get tenants in place, or you can try a free ad on your social networks.
10. Credit checks & referencing
Once you’ve found tenants, you’ll most likely want to credit check them at a cost of around £10 per check. It’s certainly money worth spending to ensure you get the right kind of tenants.
If you’re serious about becoming a landlord, we always recommend speaking to an accountant to ensure that you’re aware of all the legal requirements and financial implications of renting out a property. How much are landlord costs? The exact property maintenance costs for landlords will depend on your property, but here are some of the average landlord costs you could expect to pay for your rental property:
Recarpeting – 
£22 per m2
Repainting – 
£16 per hour
Gutter cleaning – 
£150
Roof tile replacement – 
£170 per 10 tiles
Electrical repairs – 
£150 per day
Fixing a dripping tap – 
£100
Fixing a leaking pipe – 
£100
Fixing a leaking radiator – 
£118
Fixing a leaking toilet – 
£110
Lawn care – 
£14 per month

Or, if it’s specifically students you’re planning to rent a property to, check out our guide to  student house maintenance costs . Landlord repairs responsibilities As a landlord, you have a number of responsibilities that you’ll need to be aware of. When it comes to property maintenance for landlords, as well as any of the terms set out specifically in the tenancy agreement, you’re also responsible for keeping the property in a good state of repair, including:
The structure and exterior of your home (including walls, roof, foundations, drains, guttering, pipes, windows and doors)
Bathrooms and plumbing (including sinks, basins, baths, showers, toilets and all pipework)
Water and gas pipes
Electrical wiring
Heating systems, including boilers, water tanks, radiators, fitted electric fires or fitted heaters
If you fail to meet your repair responsibilities as a landlord, you could face legal action from your tenants – which would most likely cost more in time, money and hassle than carrying out repairs in the first place.

UK Building Regulations explained,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/building-regulations/,Garage,"UK Building Regulations explained

In This Blog: What are Building Regulations in the UK? Part L Building Regulations – Conservation of fuel and power Building Regulations compliance certificate Building Regulations approval Scottish Building Regulations Hire an architect for Building Regulations planning When building, renovating, extending or converting a property, you’re going to come into contact with Building Regulations in the UK. They are guidelines that are in place to ensure that any work being carried out to create or adapt a property is done in a safe, secure and sturdy way.
In this guide, we take a look at the UK Building Regulations, which cover a wide range of topics. These include structural integrity, accessibility, ventilation, energy performance, acoustics, flood prevention, and electrical & gas safety. What are Building Regulations in the UK? Before starting any large home improvement project, it’s a good idea to familiarise yourself with UK Building Regulations so that you know the standards that any work will need to meet. And it’s worth noting that Building Regulations are separate from  planning permission . In fact, you might need both.
The first step for dealing with Building Regulations is to have a chat with your local building control team. They will be able to give you more information about any Building Regulations that might affect the work you’re planning to do. They’ll also appoint you a Building Control Officer (BCO) for the duration of your project to monitor and inspect the work being done.
Here’s a quick rundown of the Building Regulations Approved Documents for England and Wales.
Part A Building Regulations – Structural safety
The structural integrity of the building needs to support the weight of the building and contents for its planned use, to ensure that the property doesn’t collapse or cause instability to neighbouring buildings.
Part B Building Regulations – Fire safety
All properties must have a safe means of escape in the event of a fire, and Part B Building Regulations provide guidelines for interior and exterior fire safety of a building.
Part C Building Regulations – Site preparation and damp proofing
Preparation is key and Part C of UK Building Regulations sets out the rules for preparing and damp proofing the site of any new or extended buildings. That includes making sure that no plants, gases or ground moisture will get into the fabric of the building.
Part D Building Regulations – Toxic substances
When dealing with potentially hazardous materials that produce toxic fumes, Part D of Building Regulations covers the measures that need to be taken to prevent toxic substances reaching the people living, working or spending time in the building.
Part E Building Regulations – Soundproofing
Unwanted noise through floors and walls can be a real pain, and Part E Building Regulations helps make sure that buildings have a decent amount of soundproofing and sound insulation.
Part F Building Regulations – Ventilation
Creating a comfortable, healthy environment within a building involves having suitable ventilation throughout – and that’s what Part F Building Regulations provides the guidelines for.
Part G Building Regulations – Hygiene
One big priority for homes is that it’s a hygienic environment to live in so that sanitation and hot water are up to scratch. Hygiene standards and restrictions are set out in Part G Building Regulations.
Part H Building Regulations – Drainage and waste disposal
In addition to hygiene, drainage and waste disposal are other common priorities for homeowners and thankfully Part H Building Regulations has them covered.
Part J Building Regulations – Heating appliances
Heating appliances and boilers must all work safely and efficiently, with the appropriate level of ventilation and air supply to avoid any risk of pollution or health problems.
Part K Building Regulations – Stairs, ramps and guards
Wherever stairs, ramps or guards are involved, Part K Building Regulations provides the necessary guidelines to make sure that the building is safe, secure and fit for purpose without any risk of danger for people moving between spaces. Part L Building Regulations – Conservation of fuel and power Energy efficiency is a priority for all modern building work, to make sure that a building conserves as much fuel as possible, whilst also reducing the amount of CO2 produced, and ensuring optimum insulation for all parts of the building.

Find architects your neighbours recommend 
Part M Building Regulations – Access and facilities for people with disabilities
For the purposes of Part M Building Regulations, the term ‘people with disabilities’ refers to anyone who suffers from a limited ability to walk or who needs to use a wheelchair to get about – or anyone with impaired hearing or vision. This section details the regulations to ensure that buildings have suitable accessibility for everyone.
Part N Building Regulations – Glazing materials and protection
If people are going to come into contact with any glazing materials in a building, that glazing will need to meet certain standards and there are certain restrictions that apply – all detailed in Part N Building Regulations.
Part P Building Regulations – Electrical safety
Electrical work should always be carried out by a qualified electrician or similar professional registered under the competent person scheme. All buildings must have safe electrical systems installed and properly maintained. Building Regulations compliance certificate When you have work carried out in order to meet certain Building Regulations, you’ll need to have a compliance certificate to prove that the work has been carried out to the relevant standards. Qualified professionals, such as Gas Safe engineers and Competent Person electricians will be able to organise for Building Regulations compliance certificates to be issued – though they can take 10-15 days to be sent out.
Speak to the qualified tradespeople you hire to find out how to get a copy of Building Regulations certificates. Building Regulations approval If you hire a qualified tradesperson who is registered as part of the Competent Person Scheme in the UK, you don’t need to get separate Building Regulations approval. However, if you carry out the work yourself or hire a non-registered tradesperson, you may need to have official Building Regulations approval.
Here are some of the popular work that often requires Building Regulations approval:
Building a house or extension
House conversions
Replacing fuse boxes and connected electrics
Installing a bathroom with plumbing
Change electrics near a bath or shower
Installing a fixed air-conditioning system
Replacing doors and windows
Replacing roof coverings on pitched and flat roofs
Installing or replacing a heating system
Adding additional radiators to a heating system
If in doubt, check with your local building control team to confirm whether you’ll need Building Regulations approval or not. Scottish Building Regulations If you’re planning to carry out building work in Scotland, it’s important to note that Building Regulations will be different to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There are similarities for some topics, but there are also some very distinct differences for others.
To find out more, check out the official site for  Building Regulations Scotland .

House surveys explained,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/expert-advice/house-surveys/,Living Room,"House surveys explained

In This Blog: Different types of house surveys in the UK Reasons to have a survey when buying a house How much do house surveys cost? House surveys for mortgages Hire a local surveyor you can trust FAQs Buying a house is an exciting time, but it can be tough to know what you need to do and when. House surveys in the UK are one of those subjects that most of us have heard about, but not all of us are confident about the different types of house surveys available.
In this guide, we look at the options for the types of surveys when buying a house in the UK and which one you might need for the property you’re planning to buy. Different types of house surveys in the UK There are typically three levels for the different types of house surveys in the UK and they are:
Level 1 – Condition report
Level 2 – Condition report + Home buyer’s report
Level 3 – Building survey
The level of house purchase surveys that you choose will depend on the type and condition of the property you’re buying, as well as your own personal level of caution. You’re not legally obliged to carry out a house survey, but in most cases, it’s an extremely good idea to get one done.
If you do decide to hire a surveyor to do a house survey for you, make sure they’re an accredited member of either the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) or the Residential Property Surveyors Association (RPSA).
1. Level 1 – Condition report
The condition report is the most basic type of house survey you can get and is most suitable for people buying a modern property who want official confirmation of its condition. A level 1 house purchase survey will highlight any obvious risks or defects and identify any potential legal issues, but it won’t include any depth inspection or give you a detailed report on the findings – nor will it offer advice on any of the points that need attention.
The condition report will present the findings with a simple traffic light system: green for good condition, orange for anything that needs non-urgent attention, and red for any urgent repairs needed.

Find local surveyors your neighbours recommend 
2. Level 2 – Condition report + Home buyer’s report
A level 2 house survey is the most common in the UK, as it offers the basic condition survey as well as a more in depth report on the finding from a closer inspection of the property. When conducting a home buyer’s survey, the surveyor will check for structural problems and any issues that could potentially affect the value of the property, such as subsidence or damp.
The biggest benefit of a level 2 property survey is that you’ll get more detail about potential issues as well as advice on how to deal with them.
The one key drawback of a home buyer’s report is that it is still only a surface level survey and surveyors will only review what they can see – they won’t move furniture, lift carpet or floorboards, or dig deeper.
3. Level 3 – Building survey
If you’re looking for the most thorough house survey when buying a house, the level 3 building survey is what you need to go for. Ideal for anyone buying an older property or a property that is in noticeably bad condition. A level 3 survey is a comprehensive survey that goes further than a home buyer’s report to investigate the structural integrity of the building.
A surveyor conducting a level 3 building survey will check behind walls, under floorboards, and behind furniture to ensure they get a thorough picture of any potential issues with the property. You’ll then get a very detailed report covering all the issues found, including specific recommendations with a timeline and rough costs for any repairs that might be needed.
Due to being the most exhaustive type of house survey, a level 3 building survey is the most expensive survey available and won’t be for everyone. That said, if you’re buying a property that’s over 50 years old or looks knackered, then a building survey could be worth the initial cost. Reasons to have a survey when buying a house Although the various types of house surveys are optional, we recommend that you consider organising one when buying a house.
Here are some of the reasons why house surveys are a good idea:
House surveys give you more information about the property you’re planning to buy, and hopefully peace of mind
If any issues are uncovered in a survey, it can act as a tool to negotiate a lower price for the property
It’s best to know if there are any serious issues in case they’re a reason to pull out of a house purchase
Understanding possible repair works can help you budget for those additional costs
A property survey can help avoid any nasty surprises further down the line

Find local surveyors your neighbours recommend  How much do house surveys cost? When it comes to house survey prices, it’s no surprise that the more detailed the survey is the more it will cost. Below are the average costs of house surveys in the UK:
Level 1 survey (condition report) – 
£400 to £950
Level 2 survey (condition + home buyer’s report) – 
£400 to £1,000
Level 3 survey (building survey) – 
£600 to £1,500
To find out more about prices, check out our guide to how much  house surveys cost . House surveys for mortgages When buying a house, if you’re getting a mortgage – which most of us need to buy a house – your mortgage lender will carry out a valuation (not technically a survey). They do this to make sure that the property value is in line with the amount you’re paying and borrowing.
Lenders will use valuation companies they trust to carry out the property valuation, and many will do this for free as part of your mortgage deal. But don’t let a free valuation be the reason to choose a mortgage. Make sure you’re being offered the lowest interest rate possible, as that will save you much more money over time. Hire a local surveyor you can trust So, you’re ready to organise your house survey. Great stuff. Now it’s time to find a good local surveyor to do the job for you.
Take a look at our guide on  finding a surveyor when buying a house  for our top tips. And then start the ball rolling with our handy  search  to find a surveyor that your neighbours recommend.

Find local surveyors your neighbours recommend  FAQs How long do house surveys take?
The amount of time it takes to carry out a survey depends on the type of survey you’ve chosen and the size of the property. Here are some rough timings for the various types of house survey:
Level 1 house survey – 1 hour
Level 2 house survey – 2 to 4 hours
Level 3 house survey – Up to 8 hours
What surveys are required when buying a house?
A property survey is optional so, when buying a house, you’re under no legal obligation to have a survey done. That said, if you’re getting a mortgage then your lender will need to carry out a valuation survey to ensure that the property is worth what you’ve asked to borrow. Once valued successfully, any other kind of property survey is up to you.
How much are house surveys?
Depending on the type of survey you go for, the average  costs for house surveys  are:
Level one condition report – 
£400 to £950
Level two condition & homebuyer report – 
£450 to £1,000
Level three building survey –

There are three main types of surveys when buying a house:
A condition report, which is a basic report that lets you know the overall condition of the property.
A home buyer’s report, which highlights any issues that might affect the value of the property and will include advice on how to deal with them.
A building survey, which is the most extensive house survey available and involves a full and thorough structural survey of a property.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now To help you decide whether you want to buy a house and flip it, you’ll want to know what the average cost to flip a house is. How much you spend will depend on the amount of work required to make your property a home.
For example, if you check out our  house renovation cost guide , you can see that new windows for your house might cost around 
£2,500 – £6,000
. On the other hand, a new heating system could set you back by up to 
£8,500
.
As a ballpark cost, the average cost to flip a house could be between 
£38,000 – £74,000
 for a three-bedroom property – this could be higher depending on the amount of work needed and the cost of the fittings chosen. Labour cost to flip a house Let’s face it – you will need to plan a lot before you start the renovation process, and it helps if you know how much you’d be paying people for the work.
Plumbers and electricians generally have similar daily rates, ranging between 
£200 – £400 per day
.
Other tradespeople, including roofers, carpenters, painters, plasterers, and general builders, will charge around 
£200+ per day
.
General labourers and trainees will cost around 
£150 per day
.
Of course, these are just daily rates, so you’d need to know how long the task is going to take. It’s best to speak to tradespeople to find out if they charge by the hour, a day rate or for the total project.
For example, rewiring the entire house will take around 6 – 15 days. On the other hand, you could change a few light fixtures in a few hours.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Additional costs when flipping a house In addition to labour costs, you may also want to consider other costs involved, like  hiring a skip  during the renovation process. You may also want to  redesign  or  landscape the garden .
You may also have to pay legal fees, estate agent fees, stamp duty, survey fees, holding costs, and tax on the profit you make. You will also need to consider the cost of finance too, whether that’s through mortgage repayments/interest or opportunity cost.
Finally, you may need to get  planning permission , for which you may need to pay an additional fee.
All of these can make the average cost to flip a house higher. How long does it take to flip a house? Again, how long you take to flip a house depends on how much work you’re planning to do. You can do superficial improvements, like a fresh plaster or coat of paint, in just a few weeks.
On the other hand, If you’re planning to gut the house and redo it completely, you’re looking at a few months.

Find a builder your neighbours recommend  What should I look for in a house that I want to flip? To make it profitable for you, you need to make sure that the house you buy to sell is worth it.
The first thing you need to do is check if the renovations required don’t exceed the final value of the property. You don’t want to buy a house, renovate it and then realise you’ve spent more than you will earn from it!
The second thing to check is where it’s located. As you’d know, when it comes to property, it’s all about location, location, location. If the house is in a desirable area, with schools, transport, amenities around it, you know you’ll get a good price for it. How do I flip a house for the first time? If you’re trying your hand at flipping a house for the first time, the first thing you need to do is get organised. Spreadsheets are your friend.
The first thing you need to do before you start the work is figuring out what work you need to do.
Our  house renovation checklist  is a great place to start.
Also, if you get a full  survey , you will have a good idea of what needs to be fixed. That could be your starting point.
After you have a list of jobs that you need to do, contact tradespeople in your area to request quotes. Make use of our  request a quote  tool to make it easier. Simply enter information about the work you need and enter your postcode and we’ll send it to three tradespeople in your area.

Find a builder your neighbours recommend  FAQs Can you flip a house with 100k?
This will depend on a lot of factors. If you’re buying a cheap property in the north, you can potentially flip a house with that money. But the further south you go, the more difficult it will be. It will also depend on the amount of work needed.
How many houses can you flip in a year?
Legally, there is no limit to how many houses you can flip in a year. It depends on how much time and money you have to invest. Say you plan to invest all your money in one house at a time. If each house takes two to three months, you could potentially flip four to six houses in a year – but this will of course be dependent on if there are any chains when buying the properties.
Is there a tax on flipping houses in the UK?
You will need to pay income tax on the profits you make by flipping a house. There are different rates of tax for a house that was previously rented and a house you’ve bought, renovated, and sold.

Cost to replace asbestos water tank,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/cost-replace-asbestos-water-tank/,"Bathroom, Loft","Cost to replace asbestos water tank

In This Blog: Cost to replace asbestos water tank Why do I need to remove my asbestos water tank? Can I replace an asbestos water tank myself? Asbestos water tank replacement quotes FAQs Asbestos is a silica-based mineral found under the ground around the world. It was first used by the ancient Persians and Greeks and then the British too in the mid 19th century.
Asbestos is fire-resistant and super flexible, and so it became the go-to building material. But in 1999, it was banned by the UK government because its asbestos fibres contained carcinogenic properties. So if your water tank was built before 1999, the chances are that it contains asbestos.
If your water tank needs maintenance or repair, we don’t advise tackling this yourself, as asbestos is a hazardous material. You will need to get in a trusted local  asbestos removal company . Read on to find out the cost of having your water tank removed by an asbestos removal specialist.

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now Cost to replace asbestos water tank It costs roughly 
£270
 to replace your asbestos water tank, but this depends on its size. If it’s a small tank, you’re looking at about 
£230.
 For a medium-sized one, it usually costs 
£270,
 while larger sizes tend to cost around 
£330. 
So, make sure you measure it beforehand. You’ll find your asbestos water tank either in the loft or another kind of void.
Commonly, the void would’ve been sealed following the water tank’s installation that means the asbestos water tank is bigger than a loft hatch or access. This leads to problems in removing the asbestos water tank.
Firstly, you’ll need to:
Measure any access hatches (check if they’re large enough for the water tank to fit through).
If not, controlled breakage may be needed to allow for safe removal and disposal.
The above two factors will influence how much it costs to replace your asbestos water tank.

Find an asbestos removal specialist near me  Why do I need to remove my asbestos water tank? They were popular throughout the mid-1930s up until the year 2000, as they were cheap and easy to get hold of. But they contain asbestos which is highly toxic.
This is why it’s vital to have your asbestos cement water tank replaced if it’s damaged and needs maintenance. You will need to hire an  asbestos removal specialist  to make sure it’s dealt with correctly. Can I replace an asbestos water tank myself? It’s best to seek the help of a professional to replace and 
remove an asbestos water 
tank, as they’re properly trained and have the correct kit.
Asbestos is extremely dangerous. This is why it’s left only to tradespeople with the appropriate safety equipment and expertise. Asbestos water tank replacement quotes If you’re trying to find out how much your asbestos water tank replacement will cost, you may need to contact an asbestos removal specialist in your area for quotes.
We suggest you approach at least three such tradespeople for quotes.
If you aren’t sure where to start, use our  request a quote  tool. Just enter the details of the job and we’ll pass on the details to three asbestos removal specialists that your neighbours have recommended.

Find an asbestos removal specialist near me  FAQs What’s included with removing an asbestos cement water tank?
The following is included for replacing an asbestos water tank:
A professional asbestos expert with the correct protection
Keeping people away from the work area using barriers
The right access equipment for high-level work
Controlling asbestos dust using special liquid and sprayers
Possible controlled breakage
Transporting and storing the asbestos waste correctly
Cleaning the work area appropriately
Providing you with an asbestos waste certificate on completion
Covering areas that need appropriate protection
Do I need an asbestos survey?
It’s relatively straightforward for a professional asbestos expert to visually identify an asbestos water tank. Make sure you send clear photos to your chosen tradesperson so they can determine whether or not there’s any extra sampling or testing needed.
If your local asbestos professional thinks additional identification is required, they’ll carry out specialist asbestos sampling.
Typically, this is adequate to determine the fundamental requirements in terms of removing the asbestos water tank safely. But if it’s a larger property or part of a larger project, it may not be necessary to carry out an asbestos survey.

Find a recommended plumber near you  Water dye for leak detection quotes Your local plumber will use a highly concentrated, toxic-free water dye to detect leakage from fixed pipework, ceilings, bathrooms, flat roofs, drains, toilets, and swimming pools. Water dye can also identify leaks in cavities and voids. Thermal imaging for water leak detection Thermal imaging, otherwise known as ‘thermography’, uses measurement cameras and infrared imaging to detect and measure thermal energy produced from an object. These clever cameras expose problem areas that we can’t see with our own eyes, identifying hidden water leaks.
Using a thermal imaging camera can detect hidden moisture and water problems and saves resorting to more vicious testing techniques. Thermal imaging cameras can’t distinguish moisture within the wall, however, they can find the subtle temperature differences and patterns to discover the existence of water. Is using an infrared camera for water leak detection effective? Yes, using an infrared camera to find a water leak is incredibly effective because it senses and translates the radiation emitted by objects into thermal pictures. These pictures allow a water leak professional to gain a glimpse into the temperature differences within the wall cavity. In turn, it reveals the existence of water. FAQs How much does it cost to detect a water leak?
As mentioned above, the average cost to detect a water leak is 
£500.
 For a more detailed breakdown, have a look at our cost table above.
How are water leaks detected?
A plumber can detect and fix a water leak efficiently using specialist equipment.
It’s good to keep an eye on the following to stop a potential leak getting any worse:
Monitor your water bill
Check cupboards located beneath bathroom, kitchen, and laundry sinks
Look for puddles underneath the bases of toilets, showers, and underneath dishwashers, washing machines, and water heaters
Watch the water meter
Keep an eye out for patches of greener grass in the garden
Is there a tool to detect a water leak?
Yes, a plumber will use a range of tools to detect a water leak, including:
Thermal imaging cameras
Video inspection tools
Listening discs and ground microphones
How do you find a water leak in your house?
Here are some ways you can find a water leak in your house:
Monitoring your water usage frequently
Spotting a decrease in water pressure when you’re having a shower or filling up the bath
Noticing when your water heater or boiler switches on

There is nothing like a good recommendation, and a lot of local tradespeople rely on word of mouth – so ask people you know. Sometimes tradespeople ask to leave boards outside peoples homes that they have worked on, so see if you can spot any in your street.
A really fast way to find a good tiler is to search online directories like  ours . Simply type in your postcode and check out the results in your local area. The best thing about using Checkatrade is that you can be safe in the knowledge that not only are our members checked, but our reviews are too, so you know you can trust the reviews you see.
Local tradespeople often have a network of connections in other trades from working together on jobs. If you know or have used a kitchen fitter or a plumber, they might well know a good tiler they can recommend.
Another great way is to look on social media. You can either search for local businesses or follow and search bathroom design hashtags to see if the tradesperson responsible for the work has been tagged. If there are pictures it also gives you a sneak peek at their work and maybe even shows you some comments or reviews.

Will they visit you to create a quote or estimate?
Finding a good bathroom tiler will be much easier if you can get answers to these questions.

Be wary of any tradesperson where you cannot find much information about them on or offline.

Discuss your ideas with your partner or family and collect pictures or write down (or draw) a description of what you would like.

How long before you can start?
How long will the work take?

In This Blog: How to hide plumbing pipes in a bathroom How do you hide exposed bathroom pipes? How to hide pipes under a bathroom sink How to hide pipes under a hanging bathroom sink How to hide toilet pipes How to cover pipes in a bathroom affordably Finding a reliable, local tradesperson How much does a plumber cost? There’s no avoiding bathroom pipes, as they’re vital for carrying water and channelling waste from your bathroom. Unfortunately, these pipes tend to look quite ugly and can make your bathroom feel messy and crowded if they’re on show.
Today we’ll explain the different ways to hide your bathroom pipes. From boxing in to concealing pipes behind a wall, we’ve got you (and your pipes!) covered. With tips for anyone on a budget, as well as guidance for disguising toilet, waste and sink pipes. How to hide plumbing pipes in a bathroom There are a few different ways to hide the plumbing in your bathroom. This means you can pick the best option for your home. In fact, learning how to hide plumbing pipes in a bathroom isn’t too complicated, just consider the following methods:
Boxing pipes in
: This method involves surrounding your bathroom pipes with a box made of wood.
Hiding pipes in a wall
: It’s possible to run any pipes straight into a wall to avoid exposed piping.
Choosing bathroom fixtures with inbuilt pipe space
: Buying a pedestal sink, for example, will mean your sink pipes can be concealed in the stand of the sink itself.
Using bathroom furniture
: Some people choose to buy bathroom furniture like an under-sink unit to hide unsightly pipes.
Adding a fake/stud wall
: One of the more complicated methods, here you build a false wall to conceal any bathroom pipes.

Find bathroom fitters your neighbours recommend  How do you hide exposed bathroom pipes? You can hide exposed bathroom pipes by boxing them in. You’ll need the following tools and materials:
Tape measure
Spirit level
Wooden 2 x 4s
Saw
Strong wood glue
Caulk
Paint
It’ll also really come in handy if you have some kind of clamp to hold your pieces of wood together while they dry. Once you have everything you need, use the below steps to beautifully conceal your pipes:
Using your tape measure, carefully check the length of your pipes, their width and their depth. Make sure to recheck your measurements to be sure they’re accurate.
Mark and cut the 2 x 4s to the sizes you took down in step 1.
Apply your wood glue to the middle piece of wood where it’ll meet the other pieces. Remember, you’re leaving the top, bottom and back of your box open.
Clamp the pieces of wood together and leave to dry overnight to ensure the glue has properly set.
Use caulk to seal your open box to the wall, floor, and ceiling of your bathroom. Make sure it’s completely flush for a neat finish.
You can then paint or tile your new pipe box to match the rest of your bathroom. How to hide pipes under a bathroom sink Your bathroom sink is often one of the main areas where pipes can be seen running from the basin to your bathroom floor. To help with this, we’ve gathered a few different ideas for hiding exposed pipes under a bathroom sink. These methods are perfect if you’re unsure how to hide pipes under your bathroom sink.
Why not consider:
Adding storage to conceal the pipes
Positioning a plant to cover the pipes
Building a shelf or box to hide the pipes
Installing a sink skirt How to hide pipes under a hanging bathroom sink Hanging bathroom sinks look stunning and are a great way of saving space in a small bathroom. Unfortunately, these sinks will still need pipes to function which can take away from your carefully decorated bathroom.
So, let’s look at how to hide pipes under a hanging bathroom sink. In fact, the best ways of hiding wall hung basin pipes are to:
Wrap the pipes with coloured, patterned or textured insulation wraps.
Buy a pedestal that fits underneath your sink to hide the ugly pipes from view.
Choose a sink skirt that suits the style and design of your bathroom. How to hide toilet pipes Let’s be honest, no one considers a toilet waste pipe to be glamorous. Wide and unattractive, these pipes carry out an essential job but are certainly not going to win any beauty contests.
Hiding your toilet waste pipe can be done in a few ways but some of the best ways to hide toilet pipes are as follows:
Using a cistern unit
: This piece of furniture will disguise your toilet cistern and pipes.
Buying a wall hung toilet
: The cistern and pipes will be hidden in your bathroom wall for a streamlined, clean finish.
Building a fake wall
: Time consuming and potentially expensive, this method is highly effective but is by no means the simplest choice. How to cover pipes in a bathroom affordably For those on a budget, there are ways of concealing your bathroom pipes without breaking the bank. Below, we’ve gathered a few methods to cover pipes in a bathroom affordably:
Painting
: If you don’t mind the look of your pipes but hate the colour, a very cheap way of improving the way they look is to paint them. You can choose a colour that blends with your bathroom, or even one that stands out to make a feature of your bathroom pipes.
Fitting a sink skirt
: Made from fabric, these skirts hang from your sink using Velcro and hide any pipes.
Wrapping
: You can also wrap the pipes in your bathroom with insulation that co-ordinates with the rest of the room.

How to build a log store,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/build-log-store/,"Garage, Garden","How to build a log store

In This Blog: Log store plans Tips on how to build a log store in the UK Log store DIY tools How to build a log store instructions How to build a log store using pallets How to build a log store roof How to build a log store against a wall FAQs If you burn wood regularly, then having a log store is a great way to store your firewood. Whether you have a wood-burning stove or open fire, having a log store will not only keep your firewood dry but also tidy.
Thinking about building one yourself? Then take a look at our handy guide to see step by step tips. If you’re not confident with DIY then you can  find a local carpenter  to build your log store. Log store plans There are lots of different log store designs out there to help you choose which design is right for you. Take a look at our stylish  log store ideas  if you need some inspiration on how to build yours. Alternatively, get in touch with a  local carpenter  who can carry out your log store plans professionally and safely, and provide expert advice and information. Tips on how to build a log store in the UK Generally, logs shouldn’t be kept inside your home or garage. Keep firewood as far afield from your house as you can to avoid attracting pests. What’s more, choose somewhere that’s easily accessible and in sunlight. Lastly, your location should have ample air circulation around the wood and be off the ground.
When selecting the best place to build your wood store, your location should be easy to access and on level ground. If you decide to have your log store on the bare ground or in the garden, ensure the base is raised off the ground to prevent any damp from seeping into the bottom row of logs.
Use three narrow battens fastened underneath the base to give it an appropriate lift – several well-positioned bricks are a good substitute. If you’d prefer to place your store against a fence or wall, leave a tiny gap between any other construction and the back of the store to enable air to flow between both. This also assists in warding off any dampness. Log store DIY tools Want to build your own log store? It couldn’t be simpler and costs next to nothing, too. All it takes are a couple of hours of your time (depending on how quick you are!) plus the following items:
Several old pallets
Screws
Screwdriver
Pencil
Tape measure
Saw
Drill
Drill bit
Wood for roof and supports
Roofing felt
Four wooden posts
Galvanised nails
A hammer How to build a log store instructions Make your store base using either one or two pallets wide, but this depends on the number of logs you want to store.
At each corner of the pallet base, secure your four wooden posts into the earth. For a more secure base, consider using cement mix or sand to fix it into place. To give a sloped roof, either the front or rear two posts must be a little higher.
Make your slatted side and back panels by breaking down several pallets or using wooden planks and ensure they’re equally spaced out and affixed using nails.
Repeat this step for the roof. However, make sure you don’t leave any space between the panels, as you don’t want any rain getting in.
To allow optimum air circulation for effective log seasoning, store your logs inside according to their size or shape.

Find a carpenter near you  How to build a log store using pallets A cheaper option to build a log store is to make yours out of regular wood pallets. It’s crucial to plan correctly, so firstly, be sure to:
Measure your pallet at the base
Select an area with plenty of room to build the finished wood store
Ensure the location is easily accessible and shielded from the elements
Look for places near your home, hedges, and garden walls How to build a log store roof While your log store roof won’t be airtight, it will keep most of the rain off the logs and enable air to circulate into the firewood. To build its roof, you will need to:
Make sure the roof slopes away from the wall
Build it so it’s cavernous enough to hold a few faces of logs
Use two posts that are either set in concrete into the earth or secured into paving using post fixers or bolts
Starting from the posts, extend two sections of wood to the wall then affix the roof to these
You can make the roof from a piece of overlap fencing or old roof tiles secured to cross beams How to build a log store against a wall You’ll need to build a frame for the base and put posts at every corner – and potentially the centre, too. Next, wrap these around with additional lengths of wood and cover them with the roof.

Find a carpenter near you  FAQs What is a log store?
A log store is used for storing and drying logs and firewood to protect them from the elements.
What’s a log store used for?
Fresh firewood needs to burn properly, which is where log stores come into play – they decrease a log’s water content so it seasons in the right way. This ultimately allows it to burn correctly.
Why do I need a log store?
If you want to get the most out of your wood, then it’s essential to build a wood store in the right way to enable the necessary seasoning, typically for six to 12 months. If you don’t do this, you’ll see less burn time and less heat which isn’t good news. There’s also the chance of environmentally harmful smoke being emitted, so it’s vital to plan for the winter months. Building a log store will allow you to reap the full benefits from your fuel when you need a fire.
Log stores are beneficial for several reasons, including:
Keeping the rain off your log supply
Preventing ground moisture
Promoting airflow between logs
Stopping the bottom layer of logs getting wet
Preventing mould and rot from spreading to other logs
Keeping logs suitably dry for an immediate fire
More efficient burning of your fire as fewer logs are needed to heat your home
Where is the best place to put a log store?
The best place to put a log store is in a south-facing garden where there’s a draft or wind. But bear in mind this location may be too far from your home. In the colder months, this isn’t ideal, as you’ll have to brave the cold to collect more firewood.
Do logs get wet in the log store?
No, your logs won’t get overly wet in a log store, especially if they’re kept in a construction complete with a sloping roof. Wood stores such as this help rainwater run-off. However, in particularly bad weather, it’s best to place a tarpaulin over the front of the store to keep firewood dry.

Move to the radiator that heated up first and close the valve before opening it again by turning the valve a quarter turn.
Wait until the radiator heats up, then measure the temperature on the pipe connecting to its first valve.
Check the temperature at the valve on the other side of the radiator and slowly open the valve until there is a difference of 12 degrees Celsius from the temperature you took in stage 9.
Make sure to allow the temperature to change after each small turn of the valve before making any further adjustments.
Go to each radiator on your list, moving from the quickest heating radiator to the slowest, making the adjustments described in steps 8 – 11. How to balance central heating radiators Balancing your central heating system may be necessary if the rooms of your home are heating unevenly. The good news is that balancing central heating radiators can be done by following the steps we’ve outlined above.

Find radiator experts your neighbours recommend  How to balance radiators without a thermometer You may not have a digital thermometer just lying around the house to measure the temperature of your radiator pipes. The good news is, that it’s possible to learn how to balance radiators without a thermometer. You’ll still need to follow steps 1 – 7 of our ‘how do you balance radiators’ section, but after that use the following steps:
Start by opening the valve on the first radiator on your list a quarter turn.
You can then open the valve of the last radiator on your list all the way.
The other radiator valves will need to be opened different amounts based on their order in your list.
For example, the first radiator should be opened 25%, the second by 30%, the next by 40% and so on until you reach 100% on your last radiator.
Depending on how many radiators you have, try to spread the opening percentages evenly throughout your home. How to rebalance radiators Something many homeowners wonder is how to rebalance radiators. Luckily, rebalancing and balancing radiators is the same process and both terms have the same meaning. So,  jump back to our step-by-step guide  for the details. Replacing your radiators If you’re having issues with your radiators even after bleeding and balancing them, it may be necessary to order replacements. If you want to try this yourself, view our detailed  how to replace a radiator guide. Alternatively, if you’re wondering how much it costs to replace a radiator, you can view our  radiator replacement cost guide , which has all the prices and information you’ll need.

How to build a compost bin in 4 easy steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/build-compost-bin/,Garden,"How to build a compost bin in 4 easy steps

In This Blog: How to build a compost bin How to build a compost bin from wood pallets How to build a worm compost bin FAQs If you want to learn how to build a compost bin, then this blog is exactly where you need to be. We’re going to show you the best DIY solution so you can enjoy the satisfaction of doing your bit for the environment.
That’s right, by composting at home, you’re stopping your kitchen and garden waste from ending up in a landfill, which releases harmful gases like methane that aren’t very good for the planet. Also, it saves you money forking out for compost when making your own is easy.
Read on for how to build a compost bin out of pallets. How to build a compost bin This blog is going to focus on how to build a compost bin out of wood pallets.
Tools you’ll need for the job
To get started, you’ll need to add the following items to your arsenal:
4 healthy wooden pallets
6 long wooden stakes
Strong metal wire
Spade
Rake
Sledgehammer
Bow saw
Chicken wire

Hire a gardener your neighbours recommend  How to build a compost bin from wood pallets Step 1: Clear the area so you can build a simple compost bin
Find a good place to build your compost bin. A shady area further away from your house is the best option, especially if your compost bin doesn’t have a lid.
Next, use your rake to clear the area. An earth base is better for drainage and grants access to soil organisms, which you need to help break down your household waste. Use your spade to level the ground.
Top tip:
 Adding a layer of chicken wire where your bin sits will stop any rats from getting into your compost.
Step 2: Build the back of your compost bin
Take one of the pallets and position it horizontally at the far end of where you want your compost bin to go. Then, taking your stakes, drive two of them through either end of the pallets (one plank in from each side). They should sit in the middle – between the top and bottom layer of the pallets so the pallet can be secured by driving the stakes through the middle and into the ground. Use your sledgehammer to make sure they go about 25cm deep.
Step 3: Add two other pallets adjacent to the first
Take your two other pallets and place them at right angles on either side of the staked back pallet. Push them in tight so no compost can spill through and secure them with stakes.
Once you have your U shape, use your metal wire to stabilise the pallets together in each corner. Then, if there’s any of the stake still sticking out at the top, either sledgehammer them in so they’re flush to the top or trim them with your bow saw.
Step 4: Build a compost bin wood gate
Your last pallet is going to be used as a gate. To do this, attach it to one side of the U and secure it with wire so it can open and close.
Top tip: 
Use an old sheet or piece of carpet over the top of the compost bin to help trap moisture and speed up the composting process. How to build a worm compost bin Worms can be added to any compost bin, including one made out of pallets. They’re beneficial for speeding up the composting process and help maintain your compost ecosystem. As macroorganisms, they do this by self-regulating their numbers and consuming decomposing matter efficiently.
We recommend adding red wrigglers, which are perfect because they like to make their way through the surface of your compost and don’t mind crowded conditions or higher temperatures. Also, the resulting compost is great for your plants.

Hire a gardener your neighbours recommend  FAQs What is the best way to build a compost bin?
Choosing the best type of compost bin depends on your requirements. For example, a small garden might benefit from a plastic compost bin. An environmental garden might prefer a DIY version like the one we’ve described above. And a gardener with extra space might benefit from building their own large compost bin out of wood.
How do I build a compost bin?
There are several ways to build a compost bin, but the easiest way is our 4-step method above using pallets and stakes. However, if you’re looking for a more professional compost bin, why not  hire one of our professionals  to install one for you? Not only will they make sure the design works for your garden, but they’ll also build it to last.
Should I hire a professional?
For a robust finish and the peace of mind that comes with knowing your compost bin will weather any storm, we recommend  hiring a professional  to build your compost bin. The last thing you want is a poorly managed waste pile, which can cause issues with the health of your garden if left unaddressed.
What do I put at the bottom of my compost bin?
After you’ve built or had your compost bin installed, you need to put down a layer of coarse material to help encourage aeration. This can be anything such as sticks, corn cobs, vegetable stalks and other thick, fibrous matter. Then add weeds, grass and greens and your vegetables.
Will my compost bin attract rats?
If your compost bin attracts rats or mice, it’s because it’s too dry. Simply water it to deter vermin. That said, rats and mice will visit your compost bin if they’re in the area, which is why putting down a layer of chicken wire will help stop them from stealing any food waste you’ve recently added.

How to repressurise a boiler,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/repressurise-boiler/,"Bathroom, Kitchen","How to repressurise a boiler

In This Blog: What does repressurising a boiler mean? Why would you need to repressurise a boiler? How to repressurise a boiler How to repressurise a combi boiler How to repressurise a Worcester boiler How to repressurise a Baxi boiler How to repressurise a Vaillant boiler Boiler repressurising from someone you can trust How much does a new boiler cost to be installed by a professional? Which tradesperson should you use for the job? Boilers work tirelessly to provide us with a constant supply of warm water and keep our homes toasty warm. Given their essential nature, having a boiler lose pressure and performance at the worst possible time isn’t ideal. So, taking the time to learn how to repressurise a boiler is a wise choice.
Keep reading to discover how to repressurise a range of different boilers with step-by-step guides. We’ll also be covering the cost of a new or replacement boiler in case it’s time for you to upgrade. What does repressurising a boiler mean? Boilers are designed to control your central heating system, funnelling water throughout your home to warm your radiators and supply hot water to your taps. They’re essential to keeping things running smoothly but can start to lose pressure over time. Repressurising a boiler involves topping up the water level in your central heating system to allow it to function properly. Why would you need to repressurise a boiler? You can check your boiler pressure by looking at the gauge on the front of the boiler itself. There’ll be a needle that indicates the boiler pressure. If it’s low you’ve got a problem.
So, what are the reasons you may need to repressurise a boiler? There are two main causes of low boiler pressure, the first of which is that you have recently bled your radiators. This allows air to escape your system, lowering the pressure.
The second cause of low pressure is that you have a leak somewhere in your home. You should keep an eye out for any drips or damp patches throughout your property and if you find a suspected leak, call a professional to make the necessary repairs.

Find a boiler specialist near you  How to repressurise a boiler Ok, you may be wondering how to repressurise a boiler. Well, not every boiler is the same, so the process may be different for each machine. We’ll be exploring a few different methods to repressurise a boiler so you may prefer to skip ahead to the relevant section of this guide to save time.
First, we’ll be looking at how to use a filling key, which can be done as follows:
Verify that your boiler pressure is low by checking the needle on the front gauge.
Completely switch off your boiler and leave it for at least four hours to cool down.
Unclip the filling key from the tray below your boiler.
Next, push your key into the manifold keyhole, located adjacent to the manifold nut, and turn to unlock.
The pressure in your boiler should begin to rise. Wait till the gauge reads 1.5 bars before turning the key backwards.
Reclip your filling key to the underside of your boiler and push the tray back into place.
You can now turn your boiler back on.
Top tip: 
If the pressure in your boiler rises too much, you can bleed any of your radiators to reduce this. How to repressurise a combi boiler Combi boilers house a water heater and a boiler in one unit, meaning there’s no need for a large water tank. Water is heated as it runs from the water mains, making these boilers very efficient and space-saving.
Unfortunately, combi boilers can also lose pressure but don’t worry, the below steps will teach you how to repressurise a combi boiler using a filling loop:
As in the above section, make sure to completely switch off your boiler at least four hours before you start work to give it sufficient time to cool down.
Take a minute to check that both filling loop hose ends are properly attached.
Open both of your filling valves using their handles (you may need to use a screwdriver) to allow cold water to flood your system.
Watch the pressure gauge rise to between 1 and 1.5 bars before you close the filling valves again.
Finally, turn your boiler back on. How to repressurise a Worcester boiler Worcester is a fairly common brand of boiler but there are a range of different models available. Let’s look at how to repressurise a Worcester boiler using an external filling loop:
As always, start by switching off your boiler and allowing it to cool for at least four hours.
Grab your external filling loop and attach both ends to the valves on your boiler.
Open the taps on both valves letting water flow from the mains and enter your central heating system.
Carefully watch the gauge on your Worcester boiler and once the needle reaches just over 1 bar, switch off both taps.
Detach the external filling loop at both ends, being prepared for drips.
You can then switch your boiler back on and check it is functioning correctly. How to repressurise a Baxi boiler Learning how to repressurise a Baxi boiler will depend on the type of model you own. There are many different types of Baxi boilers, each with its own differences. How to repressurise a Vaillant boiler Vaillant is another popular brand of boiler. If you find your hot water or central heating system isn’t running as well as it should be, it may be time to learn how to repressurise your Vaillant boiler. You can check the pressure on your boiler by looking at its display panel. You’ll see one of two types of gauge; digital or physical.
As with other boilers, you’re aiming for a pressure of between 1 and 1.5 bars so if your boiler pressure is lower than this, you’ll need to top up the pressure. You can do this using the instructions earlier in this guide, but it’s likely you’ll need to use a filling loop as discussed in our ‘how to repressurise a Worcester boiler’ section.
Other types of boiler
As with any type of home appliance, boilers are available from a wide range of different brands. This can make it tricky to know exactly how to increase your boiler pressure if this falls below 1 bar. Thankfully your boiler should come with a manual that’ll cover how to do this. Boiler repressurising from someone you can trust If you’re struggling to repressurise your boiler don’t worry, our highly experienced members are here to help with any job no matter how big or small.

There you’ll find easy to read guides and articles full of essential advice for homeowners, buyers and sellers. How much does a new boiler cost to be installed by a professional? If you’re having issues with your boiler, it may be time to invest in a new one. Depending on the type of boiler you choose this can be quite expensive so it’s worth doing a little research to find the best boiler for your home. With a wide range of boilers on the market, things can get a little confusing. Take a look at our  new boiler cost guide  for more information.
Having your boiler regularly serviced is key to keeping it functioning at its best, ensuring it lasts longer and preventing any future issues. Boiler servicing also reduces your risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, keeping you and your family safe and healthy.
So, how much does boiler servicing costs? Well, this will usually be an average of 
£80
. If you’d like to learn more, explore our  boiler service cost guide. Which tradesperson should you use for the job?

Find balcony experts your neighbours recommend  How much does it cost to repair a leaking balcony? Since a balcony is outside, where it is exposed to the elements, it needs to be waterproofed. Waterproofing helps keep the balcony structure from degenerating because of water damage.
The process requires you to cover your concrete or wood balcony with a layer of material that keeps water out.
However, certain problems can cause the waterproofing layer to deteriorate or become ineffective. These can be:
Water pooling on the balcony floor, due to poor drainage or an irregular surface
Handrails, balustrade tops, or connection points not sealed properly
Warped beams causing the balcony to bow
In these cases, you may first need to repair the cause of the leak before you waterproof your balcony. However, waterproofing alone can cost about 
£20 per m2
. If you’re waterproofing a larger area, you may pay around 
£25 per m2
. For a smaller area, the cost could go down to 
£18 per m2
. Balcony repair quotes If you’re trying to find out how much your balcony repair will cost, you will need to contact a balcony installer in your area for quotes. We suggest you approach at least three such tradespeople for price estimates so you can get the best rate.
If you aren’t sure where to start, you could use our ‘ Request a quote ’ tool to make life easier. Just enter the details of the job and post it. We’ll send it on to our members who come recommended by your neighbours. You’ll then be contacted by balcony installers with their quotes. FAQs How much does it cost to make a balcony?
Making a balcony will cost you between 
£1,450 
and 
£5,075 
to make a small balcony. But this depends on the kind of materials you’ll use, labour, its size and design during construction. Bear in mind that materials and labour contribute to half of the total cost.
Also, you’ll need  planning permission to build a balcony , so be sure to check with your Local Planning Authority before building one.
How long does a balcony last?
If you care for it properly, a balcony should last many years. A concrete balcony can easily last for 50 years or more. How do I check if my balcony needs repairs? If your balcony has cracks in the concrete, especially older and deeper cracks, it may mean your balcony needs repair. Discolouration could imply water damage. If your balcony rails are rusted or move when you apply force on them, it could mean they are not as secure as they should be. This can be dangerous and would need fixing immediately.
What is a false balcony? Juliet balconies  are often called false balconies because they don’t project out.

Which tradesperson should you use for the job? Time to take the plunge The health benefits of swimming are vast, with both mental and physical advantages. Swimming can help to reduce anxiety, strengthen your body, and even improve your cardiovascular health. Owning a swimming pool is a dream for many homeowners so why not make this a reality and learn how to build a swimming pool at home?
Today, we’ll be covering the steps for building a swimming pool in your garden, plus tips on how to build a cheap swimming pool. We’ll even be looking at the costs of building a pool. So, keep reading to make your dream a reality. The benefits of building your own swimming pool If you’re lucky enough to have the space, building your own swimming pool will help to enrich your life in a variety of different ways. In addition to health benefits, owning a swimming pool is a fantastic way of adding value to your home and building something that will benefit every member of your family.
Below are some of the brilliant benefits of building your own swimming pool:
Save on the cost of labour:
 If you plan to build your own swimming pool you’ll save on the cost of labour.
Great for relaxing
: Swimming is ideal for unwinding after a hard day. It helps reduce mental stress and muscle tension, allowing you to relax.
Good exercise
: Perfect for anyone who struggles to exercise on land, swimming doesn’t put a strain on your joints like other types of activity. In fact, swimming can help you to reach a healthy weight, tone your muscles, strengthen your heart, and increase your endurance.
Fun for parties and socialising
: What better backdrop for a party than owning your own swimming pool. You can socialise with your guests while exercising together or even playing games in your pool.
Keeps the kids entertained
: Any parent knows the challenge of keeping kids busy during school holidays. Having a swimming pool gives them a constant source of entertainment while keeping them fit and healthy. Just make sure they’re always monitored for safety.
Great for cooling down on a hot day
: During the summer there’s nothing better than cooling off in your own swimming pool. Preparation for building a swimming pool in the UK The first step when learning how to build a swimming pool in the UK is planning. First, you’ll need to choose a perfect location. This can be anywhere on your property that’s clear of trees and bushes, is flat, gets the right amount of sunlight, and is easy to access for excavation vehicles.
Next, consider the size and shape of your new pool. Decide how deep you want the pool to be, where you’ll place exits and pick a size and shape that fits well within the space.
You’ll also need to choose what material your pool will be built from. You can choose from concrete, fibreglass, and vinyl lined options. However, bear in mind that concrete pools take the most time to install.
It’s also important to know the risks of building a pool. This is not a job for a DIY beginner, in fact, you could cause damage to your home or garden and injury to yourself if you don’t know what you’re doing. We’d always recommend hiring a professional to tackle the more challenging parts of this project like operating heavy machinery and large vehicles.

Find a trusted local pool company  How to build a swimming pool step-by-step Unfortunately, swimming pool construction is not a quick, easy job. The whole process can take anything from weeks to months, so be prepared for this when starting your swimming pool journey.
Wondering how to build a swimming pool step-by-step? Below are the main stages to follow:
Mark out the shape and size of your swimming pool.
Dig a hole to the correct dimensions of your pool. You’ll need to use an excavator, which we wouldn’t recommend operating yourself if you don’t have prior experience and training.
Even out the bottom of the hole you’ve just excavated by adding a layer of washed gravel subsoil and raking, then flattening it down.
Use steel supports to create a grid covering the sides and base of the hole.
Lay out the plumbing required for your swimming pool. This includes filtration, circulation systems and drains.
Add the electrics that will power your pool. Working with electrics is very dangerous so hiring an electrician is the safest option here.
For concrete pools, pour the concrete so it covers the walls and base of your hole, then grade and flatten while wet.
For fibreglass pools, position the structure using a crane, then fill in the area around the pool with concrete and soil.
For vinyl lined pools, first, pour the concrete as described in step 7 then lay the sheet covering the space. The vinyl will need to be stretched to allow a smooth covering, then tacked into place before any air is removed using a vacuum.
Finally, fill your new pool with water, then add chlorine and any other essential chemicals to keep it clean and kill any bacteria. Considerations for building a swimming pool in your garden When considering how to build a swimming pool in your garden, you’ll need to look at how this addition will fit into your outside space.
You’ll of course need to sacrifice a large portion of your garden, so this may not be the best choice for smaller outside spaces. Having said that, installing a pool can hugely enhance the appearance and usage of your garden. You can even build a deck around the pool with loungers, making this a stunning feature. Advice on building a concrete swimming pool Now we know how advantageous a pool can be, let’s look a little closer at how to build a concrete swimming pool.
Concrete is a great choice for your pool as it’s durable and long-lasting. It can also be poured into any shape you desire. One of the downsides of using concrete is the time it takes to install. It’s likely it could take up to 12 weeks for your pool to be finished. How to build a cheap swimming pool While swimming pools are a luxury not many can afford, it’s possible to learn how to build a cheap swimming pool. For those on a budget who want all the benefits owning a pool can bring, the following ideas should help you realise your dream while saving money:
Surround a large paddling pool with  raised decking  to give the appearance of an inground swimming pool.
Build a  natural swimming pool  by digging a hole in your garden and filling it with water. You’ll need to line the sides and base of the pool with clay or another type of liner so the water stays in place.
Buy an old shipping container or  skip  and once it’s thoroughly cleaned, coated and cushioned, just add water and a ladder and enjoy.
Purchase an above ground pool then dig a hole large enough to fit the pool in your garden. You can then position your pool in the hole, creating the effect of an inground pool.

Find a trusted local pool company  How to build an indoor swimming pool Building an indoor swimming pool is a little different to an outdoor pool as this will be built into the floor of your home. It’s essential this is done by someone with the proper training and experience to prevent issues down the line.
Below we’ve outlined how to build an indoor swimming pool:
Excavate a hole in the right shape and size to accommodate your new pool. Choosing the right position is vital to ensure you don’t damage your home’s foundations and structural integrity or any pipes and wiring.
Lay out steel supports to reinforce the walls and floor of your pool.
Add any plumbing and electrics such as lighting, filtration, heating and circulation.
Cover the sides and base of the hole with concrete and allow it to cure.
Add a layer of waterproof coating to the concrete.
Lay tiles covering the walls and floor of the concrete base to create a smooth surface for swimming.
Finish by adding water and chemicals. How to build a deck around a swimming pool The best way to enhance your new swimming pool is to build a deck around it. This will give you space to add loungers and tables for relaxing and holding drinks, as well as helping the pool fit seamlessly into your garden.
If you’d like to know how to build a deck around a swimming pool yourself, the below articles will guide you through the process. They also have guidance on professionals who can help: How to build a raised deck How to lay decking How much does it cost to build a swimming pool? If adding a swimming pool to your property sounds like a brilliant idea, you’ll need to know how much to budget. Whether you choose to save the money first or take out a loan, swimming pools are not cheap to install. If you’re on a tight budget, jump back to our ‘how to build a cheap swimming pool’ section.
Otherwise, check out our  swimming pool cost guide . It’s flooded with information and advice plus a range of different prices.
Looking for average costs? As a rough guide, the average indoor swimming pool installation cost will be 
£115,000
 and the cost of an outdoor pool will be 
£85,000
. Which tradesperson should you use for the job? When it comes to building an outdoor swimming pool, you’ll need to either hire a swimming pool installation company who’ll take over the entire project, or you could hire separate tradespeople. If you go down the second route you may save money, but this also comes with the hassle of working with a variety of professionals and project managing the work.
You’ll need the help of an electrician, a plumber, a contractor… the list goes on. So, to save time, use our free  request a quote feature  which will instantly send your enquiry to three local specialist tradespeople. Time to take the plunge Making the decision to hire an expert to install your pool is a brilliant choice. In addition to saving you weeks of work and a lot of energy, using a professional is the best way to guarantee a high-quality finish. You’ll also avoid any risks and dangers involved with doing the work yourself.
One of the best ways to find a tradesperson you can trust is to  search our website . All our members are fully checked, giving you the confidence you’re hiring a reliable tradesperson for your project. Plus, you can view past customer reviews before making your decision on who to choose.

Worst home décor fails of the last 50 years,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/news/worst-home-decor-fails-of-the-last-50-years/,Tag Not Found,"Worst home décor fails of the last 50 years

With 1990s interiors fan favourite Changing Rooms re-booted and back on screens,  Checkatrade  is shining a light on some of the most questionable interior décor trends of the last 50 years revealing which should firmly be left in the past.
Polling 2,000 UK adults, the study uncovered inflatable furniture (23%), furry photo frames (22%) and animal hide rugs (20%) as the worst interior faux pas of the last half century. Meanwhile, bright purple walls as seen in Monica’s and Rachel’s apartment in 
Friends
 were also frowned upon by 16% of people.
And whilst there have been many questionable interiors trends over the years, 24% unashamedly admitted to having flowery wallpaper in their homes, along with lava lamps (24%) and patterned sofas (19%).
Worst interior design trends of the last 50 years:
Questionable interiors trends of the last 50 years we’ve had in our homes:
Inflatable furniture – 23%
Flowery wallpaper – 24%
Furry photo frames – 22%
Lava lamps – 24%
Animal hide rugs – 20%
Patterned sofa’s – 19%
Water beds – 17%
Reclining armchairs – 17%
Bright purple walls – 16%
Shap carpets/rugs – 16%
Additionally, it’s not just 
Friends’
 Joey and Chandler who have a love for lazy boy style reclining armchairs, so do one in ten people who think the furniture should return to popularity in British homes today. Whilst a further 10% want the lava lamp to see a resurgence as it did in the 1980s and 1990s.
The return of ‘90s décor trends
With many homeowners looking back on their childhood and family life with rose-tinted nostalgia, it also sees the return of ‘90s interior trends. From parquet flooring through to wicker and rattan furniture, over a quarter (26%) believe that social media has reintroduced old trends to new generations with 25% also admitting that design trends seem to be a copy of eras past rather than something new. Additionally, 23% believe that because 90s fashion is back, so too are design trends of the same decade whilst 22% simply feel we’ve run out of ideas.
‘’Whilst interior trends come and go, our research has found almost a fifth of people (18%) will redecorate their homes once every two to three years just to keep up to date with the latest trends,’’ said Mike Fairman, CEO of Checkatrade.‘’With shows like Changing Rooms back on air, it may encourage homeowners to give their home a new lease of life, and through Checkatrade you’ll be sure to find inspiration as well as recommendations you can rely on, the next time you need a tradesperson.’’
Popular 90s homes re-imagined
With so many popular programmes and films coming out of the ‘90s, just how influential were they to our home décor? In fact, despite the amount of damage Kevin McCallister caused on his family home during 
Home Alone
, 17% wish to live in the grand McCallister house most, followed by the Banks family mansion seen in 
The Fresh Prince of Bel Air
 (16%) and Monica and Rachel’s homely apartment in 
Friends
 (15%)
So, what would some of the nation’s favourite 90s sitcom rooms look like today? Checkatrade have given some a modern-day make over including:
The living room in Monica & Rachel’s Apartment, Friends
The popular purple walls of the ‘90s comedy have been given a modern lick of colour with the patterned sofas gone and replaced with neutral colouring.
The patterned curtains and lamp shades have also been updated with modern shutters and a director’s lamp. Whilst the iconic artwork remains above the TV, there is a flat screen TV to reflect modern times along with more greenery in keeping with today’s popularity of indoor plants.
The living room in the Banks family home, Fresh Prince of Bel Air
From Carlton infamously dancing to Tom’s Jones’ ‘It’s Not Usual’ through to Jeffrey ‘winning’ the lottery, the Banks living room has seen many a moment in the popular series.
The 90s living room has a bright and open feel, with a curved staircase in the background and chic 90s furniture. Today, the living room’s neutral palette has been refreshed to a bolder yet opulent colour, with velvet sofa, drinks cabinet and a more modern staircase.
Edina’s basement kitchen, Absolutely Fabulous
Arguably one of the most famous kitchens on British TV, this reimagining is based on Eddie’s original kitchen as seen in the earlier seasons of the comedy.
Known for its wooden cabinetry, the kitchen has been replaced to reflect a shaker style complete with marble bench tops.
Updated lighting above the island has also been included along with a wine fridge filled with Bollinger ready for Eddie’s and Patsy’s next escapade.

The guide to hiring the best house cleaner,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/hiring-guides/house-cleaner/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","The guide to hiring the best house cleaner

In This Blog: What is a house cleaner? Tips on how to find a house cleaner Questions to ask a house cleaner Why you should hire a house cleaner FAQs What should I know before hiring a house cleaner? Is it worth it to hire a house cleaner? How do you prepare for a cleaning person or team? Do you stay home with the house cleaner? Wondering how to find a good house cleaner? Finding a trustworthy cleaning service can be an intimidating process. What if they don’t turn up? Can you trust them around your children and pets? Will they do a great job, or will they spend time watching TV and invading the fridge instead?
With so many professional cleaning services available, it can be tricky to know what type of cleaner you need and to know what questions to ask to make sure you hire the perfect person or team.
We’ve pulled together some top tips on how to hire a house cleaner for your home. What is a house cleaner? A house cleaner is someone who maintains the cleanliness of your home regularly. A cleaner’s job includes the following:
Deep-cleaning and cleansing countertops, sinks, wall interiors, and exteriors, bathtubs, toilets, and floors.
Cleaning kitchens thoroughly, including countertops, sinks, drawers, cupboards, the inside and outside of appliances, light switch covers, the interior and exterior of microwaves and ovens, mopping, and hoovering, cleaning chairs and tables.
Sanitising, polishing, and cleaning toilets, bathrooms, bathtubs, sinks, showers, stainless steel, chrome, brass, and drains.
Scrubbing windows and sills.
Hoovering and steam-cleaning carpets and furniture.
Mopping, hoovering, and sealing floors of all kinds.
Dusting doors, picture frames, light fixtures, baseboards, furniture tops, and cupboards. Tips on how to find a house cleaner Hiring a cleaning service involves specific processes. Before letting a domestic cleaner into your house, it’s worth thinking about what makes a good cleaner. The best type of cleaner would be one that:
Turns up on time
Is friendly
Fantastic at cleaning, of course!
Trustworthy
Flexible
Respects you
Has a full understanding of cleaning
Knows how to use dangerous cleaning products safely
Goes the extra mile, e.g. spends a little more time scrubbing stubborn marks
Keeps up high cleaning standards, week after week
Boasts attention to detail (they can often spot things you can’t)
Shameless self-promo – use Checkatrade
On Checkatrade, you’ll find hundreds of professional cleaners and cleaning companies, all with relevant experience, insurance, and qualifications. All of our checked members have been checked and checked again by us. But, best of all, they’ve been reviewed by your neighbours.
Use our handy
 request a quote tool
 to find trustworthy domestic cleaners near you.

Find cleaners your neighbours recommend 
Request references
Avoid skipping this step. CRB checks are paramount when there are vulnerable adults and children in your house. So, you need to know who you’re letting inside and that they’ve had the appropriate background checks carried out.
This is particularly important if you’re trusting them with your house key and allowing them to access your home when you’re not there.
Ask the cleaner to run through the process with you
So that your cleaner can give a more accurate quote, they should be able to do a walkthrough with you and come and view your home before you agree to their services.
Check how your cleaner charges
While some house cleaners charge by the hour, others offer a flat rate per job. If you pay a cleaner per hour, they shouldn’t leave your property earlier if they claim they’ve “completed all the tasks.” So, if you’ve paid them for three hours, they must stay for the entire three hours. Questions to ask a house cleaner If you’re wondering how to find a good house cleaner, be sure to ask the agency questions to make sure you’re getting the best level of service from the cleaner.
Here are some examples of questions you can ask upfront:
How much will it cost?
How long will the cleaning take?
How do you take payment?
Are there any extra costs? Hiring a cleaner less regularly will require more costs per visit.
What days can your cleaner come?
Does the cleaner bring their own cleaning tools and equipment? If they’ll be using yours, how will they leave the tools? For instance, will they leave cleaning cloths in the sink on departure? Would they prefer you to provide particular types of cleaning products?
Will they let you try them out as a one-off before you commit to a more frequent arrangement?
Are there any tasks your cleaner won’t carry out? For instance, when it comes to corporate cleaners, they usually have policies in place where they can’t climb ladders.

Find cleaners your neighbours recommend  Why you should hire a house cleaner In today’s hectic world, upkeeping your property can be tough – because we’re busier than ever, right? Whether it’s work-filled schedules or family responsibilities, it’s no surprise we find it tricky to find time for ourselves. And even if you’re a stay-at-home-parent, why should you spend all your time housekeeping when you could reach out to a domestic cleaning service?
To help lighten the load, you can hire a house cleaner to assist you with everyday errands. You can choose more specialist house cleaning services to handle trickier tasks like oven cleaning, deep cleaning, and carpet cleaning.
Experts guarantee professionalism
As well as their knowledge and abilities, house cleaners also have the know-how. House cleaners offer you the highest quality service. Professional domestic cleaners will provide you with service of the highest standard.
Arrange frequent visits
A lot of house cleaners provide their customers with the option to sign a contract. In doing so, you can choose how often your cleaner visits your house and guarantee regular appointments on specific days. This enables you to plan your daily life and other activities.
You get back your free time
Recruiting the help of a house cleaner gives you a chance to concentrate on more essential tasks in your week rather than spending your free time cleaning your home. Instead of sacrificing your weekend dealing with this exhausting task, you could leave it to a professional.
Your house always looks spotless
When you’re too busy, ill, or have unexpected guests, it’s impossible to clean your home. Leaving the cleaning to a professional house cleaner ensures your property is always impeccably clean.

Find cleaners your neighbours recommend  FAQs What should I know before hiring a house cleaner? Here are some things to know before hiring a house cleaner:
Will you pay your cleaner hourly or a flat rate?
What tasks will you need them to carry out?
Will they do a trial period for you?
What boundaries and expectations do you have?
Are you/they flexible? For example, can you/they be flexible when it comes to the school holidays?
Put personal belongings such as unclean underwear and medication away
Let them know if you have children or pets Is it worth it to hire a house cleaner? Yes, hiring a house cleaner is well worth the cost. If your life’s hectic and you’ve always craved ditching the vacuum for some free time, this may be reason enough to reach out to one. It doesn’t cost the earth – have a look at our
 house cleaning cost guide
 to find out more about prices. How do you prepare for a cleaning person or team? You can prepare for a cleaning person or team by tidying up and picking up your clutter. This will save the cleaner spending a lot of their time shifting your things from one place to another. Do you stay home with the house cleaner? Many homeowners prefer to leave their property when the cleaner comes. This can help your cleaner work more efficiently because they won’t feel like they’re being watched all the time. If you do decide to stay while they do their job, you may get in their way.
If you feel uncomfortable about leaving the house, consider setting up a home security system so you can keep an eye on them. It doesn’t cost a lot – for an accurate guide on getting one erected, visit our

Carbon monoxide alarm installation cost guide,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/cost-guides/carbon-monoxide-alarm-installation-cost/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","Carbon monoxide alarm installation cost guide

In This Blog: Carbon monoxide alarm installation cost Where should a carbon monoxide detector be placed? Can I install a carbon monoxide alarm? How do you fit a carbon monoxide monitor? Carbon monoxide alarm installation quotes FAQs What is carbon monoxide? Do I need a carbon monoxide detector with a combi boiler? How long do hardwired carbon monoxide detectors last? How often should I change the battery in my carbon monoxide alarm? Landlords are legally obliged to have a carbon monoxide alarm installation in any room that burns fuel like wood or coal. Unfortunately, they don’t have to install one if you use gas.
However, a  gas boiler too can put you at risk of carbon monoxide poisoning . That’s why it’s always a good idea to look into getting a carbon monoxide alarm yourself if you don’t have one in your home. Carbon monoxide alarm installation cost Cost provided item

Our costs are ballpark averages –  get a local tradesperson to quote now The average cost of installing a battery-powered carbon monoxide alarm is 
£90.
 You can expect to pay slightly more for a hard-wired carbon monoxide alarm, usually 
£175
.
The price for a battery-powered alarm starts from 
£20,
 while hard-wired types cost roughly 
£100. Where should a carbon monoxide detector be placed? At least 15cm from the ceiling. You should place a carbon monoxide detector:
In any room that contains a fuel-burning appliance (fire, stove, or gas boiler)
In every room through which a flue from one of these appliances passes
In any room that you spend time in during the day and in any room that you sleep in at night Can I install a carbon monoxide alarm? Yes, you can install a carbon monoxide alarm yourself. However, battery-powered alarms don’t need to be installed. You can place it on a shelf as long as it’s at the correct distance.
If in doubt, recruit the help of a trusted local professional – we advise  getting at least three quotes .

Find alarm experts your neighbours recommend  How do you fit a carbon monoxide monitor? You’ll need to fit your monoxide monitor up high on a shelf in a room together with a fuel-burning appliance. Installation involves several screws, while other types require zero installation as they’re freestanding. It shouldn’t take any more than a couple of minutes to fit but speak to a carbon monoxide specialist if you need help with this. Carbon monoxide alarm installation quotes Installing carbon monoxide detectors doesn’t cost the earth, but you need to keep everyone in your household safe. While it’s easy to install one yourself, it’s much better to leave such a crucial task to a professional who’ll know just what to do.
We advise obtaining three quotes for your job that you can do easily by using our  request a quote form . Just fill it in, and we’ll send the details to tradespeople near you. FAQs What is carbon monoxide? Carbon monoxide (CO) is unscented, colourless, and flavourless. This hazardous gas is often a silent killer, produced when a carbon-carrying fuel (coal, natural gas, wood, petrol, charcoal, or kerosene) – doesn’t completely burn.
Using a fuel-burning appliance like a fireplace or stove causes CO emissions. The only way to identify carbon monoxide in the air is by fitting a specialist alarm. It’s important to take  gas safety  seriously in the home to protect you, your property, and anyone else living inside. Do I need a carbon monoxide detector with a combi boiler? If you’ve had a modern combi boiler fitted, it’ll most likely be room-sealed. In other words, all waste air is taken outdoors, so it’s very unlikely it’ll reach you. That said, you may want to have one fitted just in case. How long do hardwired carbon monoxide detectors last? Hardwired carbon monoxide detectors typically last between five to seven years. You should replace your detector once it’s 10 years old. If the alarm doesn’t make any noise following monthly testing or it chirps once you’ve replaced the battery before its 10-year mark, replace it. How often should I change the battery in my carbon monoxide alarm? Change the batteries in carbon monoxide alarms at least every six months. Even though you replace your batteries, these types of alarms don’t last a lifetime. However, if your alarm uses Lithium-ion batteries, you’ll’ need to change them once every five years. Otherwise, you should change them once a year.

In This Blog: How to hide plumbing pipes in a bathroom How do you hide exposed bathroom pipes? How to hide pipes under a bathroom sink How to hide pipes under a hanging bathroom sink How to hide toilet pipes How to cover pipes in a bathroom affordably Finding a reliable, local tradesperson How much does a plumber cost? There’s no avoiding bathroom pipes, as they’re vital for carrying water and channelling waste from your bathroom. Unfortunately, these pipes tend to look quite ugly and can make your bathroom feel messy and crowded if they’re on show.
Today we’ll explain the different ways to hide your bathroom pipes. From boxing in to concealing pipes behind a wall, we’ve got you (and your pipes!) covered. With tips for anyone on a budget, as well as guidance for disguising toilet, waste and sink pipes. How to hide plumbing pipes in a bathroom There are a few different ways to hide the plumbing in your bathroom. This means you can pick the best option for your home. In fact, learning how to hide plumbing pipes in a bathroom isn’t too complicated, just consider the following methods:
Boxing pipes in
: This method involves surrounding your bathroom pipes with a box made of wood.
Hiding pipes in a wall
: It’s possible to run any pipes straight into a wall to avoid exposed piping.
Choosing bathroom fixtures with inbuilt pipe space
: Buying a pedestal sink, for example, will mean your sink pipes can be concealed in the stand of the sink itself.
Using bathroom furniture
: Some people choose to buy bathroom furniture like an under-sink unit to hide unsightly pipes.
Adding a fake/stud wall
: One of the more complicated methods, here you build a false wall to conceal any bathroom pipes.

Find bathroom fitters your neighbours recommend  How do you hide exposed bathroom pipes? You can hide exposed bathroom pipes by boxing them in. You’ll need the following tools and materials:
Tape measure
Spirit level
Wooden 2 x 4s
Saw
Strong wood glue
Caulk
Paint
It’ll also really come in handy if you have some kind of clamp to hold your pieces of wood together while they dry. Once you have everything you need, use the below steps to beautifully conceal your pipes:
Using your tape measure, carefully check the length of your pipes, their width and their depth. Make sure to recheck your measurements to be sure they’re accurate.
Mark and cut the 2 x 4s to the sizes you took down in step 1.
Apply your wood glue to the middle piece of wood where it’ll meet the other pieces. Remember, you’re leaving the top, bottom and back of your box open.
Clamp the pieces of wood together and leave to dry overnight to ensure the glue has properly set.
Use caulk to seal your open box to the wall, floor, and ceiling of your bathroom. Make sure it’s completely flush for a neat finish.
You can then paint or tile your new pipe box to match the rest of your bathroom. How to hide pipes under a bathroom sink Your bathroom sink is often one of the main areas where pipes can be seen running from the basin to your bathroom floor. To help with this, we’ve gathered a few different ideas for hiding exposed pipes under a bathroom sink. These methods are perfect if you’re unsure how to hide pipes under your bathroom sink.
Why not consider:
Adding storage to conceal the pipes
Positioning a plant to cover the pipes
Building a shelf or box to hide the pipes
Installing a sink skirt How to hide pipes under a hanging bathroom sink Hanging bathroom sinks look stunning and are a great way of saving space in a small bathroom. Unfortunately, these sinks will still need pipes to function which can take away from your carefully decorated bathroom.
So, let’s look at how to hide pipes under a hanging bathroom sink. In fact, the best ways of hiding wall hung basin pipes are to:
Wrap the pipes with coloured, patterned or textured insulation wraps.
Buy a pedestal that fits underneath your sink to hide the ugly pipes from view.
Choose a sink skirt that suits the style and design of your bathroom. How to hide toilet pipes Let’s be honest, no one considers a toilet waste pipe to be glamorous. Wide and unattractive, these pipes carry out an essential job but are certainly not going to win any beauty contests.
Hiding your toilet waste pipe can be done in a few ways but some of the best ways to hide toilet pipes are as follows:
Using a cistern unit
: This piece of furniture will disguise your toilet cistern and pipes.
Buying a wall hung toilet
: The cistern and pipes will be hidden in your bathroom wall for a streamlined, clean finish.
Building a fake wall
: Time consuming and potentially expensive, this method is highly effective but is by no means the simplest choice. How to cover pipes in a bathroom affordably For those on a budget, there are ways of concealing your bathroom pipes without breaking the bank. Below, we’ve gathered a few methods to cover pipes in a bathroom affordably:
Painting
: If you don’t mind the look of your pipes but hate the colour, a very cheap way of improving the way they look is to paint them. You can choose a colour that blends with your bathroom, or even one that stands out to make a feature of your bathroom pipes.
Fitting a sink skirt
: Made from fabric, these skirts hang from your sink using Velcro and hide any pipes.
Wrapping
: You can also wrap the pipes in your bathroom with insulation that co-ordinates with the rest of the room.

How to build a log store,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/build-log-store/,"Garage, Garden","How to build a log store

In This Blog: Log store plans Tips on how to build a log store in the UK Log store DIY tools How to build a log store instructions How to build a log store using pallets How to build a log store roof How to build a log store against a wall FAQs If you burn wood regularly, then having a log store is a great way to store your firewood. Whether you have a wood-burning stove or open fire, having a log store will not only keep your firewood dry but also tidy.
Thinking about building one yourself? Then take a look at our handy guide to see step by step tips. If you’re not confident with DIY then you can  find a local carpenter  to build your log store. Log store plans There are lots of different log store designs out there to help you choose which design is right for you. Take a look at our stylish  log store ideas  if you need some inspiration on how to build yours. Alternatively, get in touch with a  local carpenter  who can carry out your log store plans professionally and safely, and provide expert advice and information. Tips on how to build a log store in the UK Generally, logs shouldn’t be kept inside your home or garage. Keep firewood as far afield from your house as you can to avoid attracting pests. What’s more, choose somewhere that’s easily accessible and in sunlight. Lastly, your location should have ample air circulation around the wood and be off the ground.
When selecting the best place to build your wood store, your location should be easy to access and on level ground. If you decide to have your log store on the bare ground or in the garden, ensure the base is raised off the ground to prevent any damp from seeping into the bottom row of logs.
Use three narrow battens fastened underneath the base to give it an appropriate lift – several well-positioned bricks are a good substitute. If you’d prefer to place your store against a fence or wall, leave a tiny gap between any other construction and the back of the store to enable air to flow between both. This also assists in warding off any dampness. Log store DIY tools Want to build your own log store? It couldn’t be simpler and costs next to nothing, too. All it takes are a couple of hours of your time (depending on how quick you are!) plus the following items:
Several old pallets
Screws
Screwdriver
Pencil
Tape measure
Saw
Drill
Drill bit
Wood for roof and supports
Roofing felt
Four wooden posts
Galvanised nails
A hammer How to build a log store instructions Make your store base using either one or two pallets wide, but this depends on the number of logs you want to store.
At each corner of the pallet base, secure your four wooden posts into the earth. For a more secure base, consider using cement mix or sand to fix it into place. To give a sloped roof, either the front or rear two posts must be a little higher.
Make your slatted side and back panels by breaking down several pallets or using wooden planks and ensure they’re equally spaced out and affixed using nails.
Repeat this step for the roof. However, make sure you don’t leave any space between the panels, as you don’t want any rain getting in.
To allow optimum air circulation for effective log seasoning, store your logs inside according to their size or shape.

Find a carpenter near you  How to build a log store using pallets A cheaper option to build a log store is to make yours out of regular wood pallets. It’s crucial to plan correctly, so firstly, be sure to:
Measure your pallet at the base
Select an area with plenty of room to build the finished wood store
Ensure the location is easily accessible and shielded from the elements
Look for places near your home, hedges, and garden walls How to build a log store roof While your log store roof won’t be airtight, it will keep most of the rain off the logs and enable air to circulate into the firewood. To build its roof, you will need to:
Make sure the roof slopes away from the wall
Build it so it’s cavernous enough to hold a few faces of logs
Use two posts that are either set in concrete into the earth or secured into paving using post fixers or bolts
Starting from the posts, extend two sections of wood to the wall then affix the roof to these
You can make the roof from a piece of overlap fencing or old roof tiles secured to cross beams How to build a log store against a wall You’ll need to build a frame for the base and put posts at every corner – and potentially the centre, too. Next, wrap these around with additional lengths of wood and cover them with the roof.

Find a carpenter near you  FAQs What is a log store?
A log store is used for storing and drying logs and firewood to protect them from the elements.
What’s a log store used for?
Fresh firewood needs to burn properly, which is where log stores come into play – they decrease a log’s water content so it seasons in the right way. This ultimately allows it to burn correctly.
Why do I need a log store?
If you want to get the most out of your wood, then it’s essential to build a wood store in the right way to enable the necessary seasoning, typically for six to 12 months. If you don’t do this, you’ll see less burn time and less heat which isn’t good news. There’s also the chance of environmentally harmful smoke being emitted, so it’s vital to plan for the winter months. Building a log store will allow you to reap the full benefits from your fuel when you need a fire.
Log stores are beneficial for several reasons, including:
Keeping the rain off your log supply
Preventing ground moisture
Promoting airflow between logs
Stopping the bottom layer of logs getting wet
Preventing mould and rot from spreading to other logs
Keeping logs suitably dry for an immediate fire
More efficient burning of your fire as fewer logs are needed to heat your home
Where is the best place to put a log store?
The best place to put a log store is in a south-facing garden where there’s a draft or wind. But bear in mind this location may be too far from your home. In the colder months, this isn’t ideal, as you’ll have to brave the cold to collect more firewood.
Do logs get wet in the log store?
No, your logs won’t get overly wet in a log store, especially if they’re kept in a construction complete with a sloping roof. Wood stores such as this help rainwater run-off. However, in particularly bad weather, it’s best to place a tarpaulin over the front of the store to keep firewood dry.

What does bleeding a radiator involve? It can be incredibly frustrating if some rooms in your home seem to be warmer than others. Nobody wants to sit in a freezing cold living room while the dining room you rarely use is toasty. If this is becoming an issue for you, you’ll need to know how to balance your radiators.
What’s the difference between bleeding and balancing a radiator?
Bleeding a radiator
 is perfect for any radiator that has cold spots. It involves releasing trapped air so that the radiator heats up evenly.
Balancing a radiator
 involves diverting more warm water to colder radiators away from burning hot radiators.

Find radiator experts your neighbours recommend  How do you balance radiators? Firstly, please note that it may be necessary to bleed your radiators before beginning. Check for any cold spots once your radiators are on and if you find any, you’ll need to bleed your radiators first.
To bleed and balance your radiators you’ll need the following tools:
Lockshield valve key
A screwdriver
A bleeding key
A digital thermometer
Pen and paper
Once you’ve gathered these, use the following steps to return your radiators to normal function:
Use our handy  how to bleed a radiator guide  before balancing your radiators if necessary.
To balance your radiators, ensure your central heating is set off and allow the radiators to completely cool down.
Take the cap off of your radiator Lockshield valves. Then use the Lockshield valve key to open the valves on all the radiators in your home.
Please note, if you have thermostatic valves on your radiators, you’ll need to open these by turning them anti-clockwise by hand.
Switch your central heating back on and move from radiator to radiator to see which one heats up first.
Take a piece of paper and make a note of the order in which your radiators heat up.
Switch your heating back off again and allow each radiator to cool down before switching back on again.
Move to the radiator that heated up first and close the valve before opening it again by turning the valve a quarter turn.
Wait until the radiator heats up, then measure the temperature on the pipe connecting to its first valve.
Check the temperature at the valve on the other side of the radiator and slowly open the valve until there is a difference of 12 degrees Celsius from the temperature you took in stage 9.
Make sure to allow the temperature to change after each small turn of the valve before making any further adjustments.
Go to each radiator on your list, moving from the quickest heating radiator to the slowest, making the adjustments described in steps 8 – 11. How to balance central heating radiators Balancing your central heating system may be necessary if the rooms of your home are heating unevenly. The good news is that balancing central heating radiators can be done by following the steps we’ve outlined above.

Find radiator experts your neighbours recommend  How to balance radiators without a thermometer You may not have a digital thermometer just lying around the house to measure the temperature of your radiator pipes. The good news is, that it’s possible to learn how to balance radiators without a thermometer. You’ll still need to follow steps 1 – 7 of our ‘how do you balance radiators’ section, but after that use the following steps:
Start by opening the valve on the first radiator on your list a quarter turn.
You can then open the valve of the last radiator on your list all the way.
The other radiator valves will need to be opened different amounts based on their order in your list.
For example, the first radiator should be opened 25%, the second by 30%, the next by 40% and so on until you reach 100% on your last radiator.
Depending on how many radiators you have, try to spread the opening percentages evenly throughout your home. How to rebalance radiators Something many homeowners wonder is how to rebalance radiators. Luckily, rebalancing and balancing radiators is the same process and both terms have the same meaning. So,  jump back to our step-by-step guide  for the details. Replacing your radiators If you’re having issues with your radiators even after bleeding and balancing them, it may be necessary to order replacements. If you want to try this yourself, view our detailed  how to replace a radiator guide. Alternatively, if you’re wondering how much it costs to replace a radiator, you can view our  radiator replacement cost guide , which has all the prices and information you’ll need. The cost to remove and replace a double panel radiator is £200. Need help from a trustworthy expert? Balancing your radiators can be time-consuming.

How to build a compost bin in 4 easy steps,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/build-compost-bin/,Garden,"How to build a compost bin in 4 easy steps

In This Blog: How to build a compost bin How to build a compost bin from wood pallets How to build a worm compost bin FAQs If you want to learn how to build a compost bin, then this blog is exactly where you need to be. We’re going to show you the best DIY solution so you can enjoy the satisfaction of doing your bit for the environment.
That’s right, by composting at home, you’re stopping your kitchen and garden waste from ending up in a landfill, which releases harmful gases like methane that aren’t very good for the planet. Also, it saves you money forking out for compost when making your own is easy.
Read on for how to build a compost bin out of pallets. How to build a compost bin This blog is going to focus on how to build a compost bin out of wood pallets.
Tools you’ll need for the job
To get started, you’ll need to add the following items to your arsenal:
4 healthy wooden pallets
6 long wooden stakes
Strong metal wire
Spade
Rake
Sledgehammer
Bow saw
Chicken wire

Hire a gardener your neighbours recommend  How to build a compost bin from wood pallets Step 1: Clear the area so you can build a simple compost bin
Find a good place to build your compost bin. A shady area further away from your house is the best option, especially if your compost bin doesn’t have a lid.
Next, use your rake to clear the area. An earth base is better for drainage and grants access to soil organisms, which you need to help break down your household waste. Use your spade to level the ground.
Top tip:
 Adding a layer of chicken wire where your bin sits will stop any rats from getting into your compost.
Step 2: Build the back of your compost bin
Take one of the pallets and position it horizontally at the far end of where you want your compost bin to go. Then, taking your stakes, drive two of them through either end of the pallets (one plank in from each side). They should sit in the middle – between the top and bottom layer of the pallets so the pallet can be secured by driving the stakes through the middle and into the ground. Use your sledgehammer to make sure they go about 25cm deep.
Step 3: Add two other pallets adjacent to the first
Take your two other pallets and place them at right angles on either side of the staked back pallet. Push them in tight so no compost can spill through and secure them with stakes.
Once you have your U shape, use your metal wire to stabilise the pallets together in each corner. Then, if there’s any of the stake still sticking out at the top, either sledgehammer them in so they’re flush to the top or trim them with your bow saw.
Step 4: Build a compost bin wood gate
Your last pallet is going to be used as a gate. To do this, attach it to one side of the U and secure it with wire so it can open and close.
Top tip: 
Use an old sheet or piece of carpet over the top of the compost bin to help trap moisture and speed up the composting process. How to build a worm compost bin Worms can be added to any compost bin, including one made out of pallets. They’re beneficial for speeding up the composting process and help maintain your compost ecosystem. As macroorganisms, they do this by self-regulating their numbers and consuming decomposing matter efficiently.
We recommend adding red wrigglers, which are perfect because they like to make their way through the surface of your compost and don’t mind crowded conditions or higher temperatures. Also, the resulting compost is great for your plants.

Hire a gardener your neighbours recommend  FAQs What is the best way to build a compost bin?
Choosing the best type of compost bin depends on your requirements. For example, a small garden might benefit from a plastic compost bin. An environmental garden might prefer a DIY version like the one we’ve described above. And a gardener with extra space might benefit from building their own large compost bin out of wood.
How do I build a compost bin?
There are several ways to build a compost bin, but the easiest way is our 4-step method above using pallets and stakes. However, if you’re looking for a more professional compost bin, why not  hire one of our professionals  to install one for you? Not only will they make sure the design works for your garden, but they’ll also build it to last.
Should I hire a professional?
For a robust finish and the peace of mind that comes with knowing your compost bin will weather any storm, we recommend  hiring a professional  to build your compost bin. The last thing you want is a poorly managed waste pile, which can cause issues with the health of your garden if left unaddressed.
What do I put at the bottom of my compost bin?
After you’ve built or had your compost bin installed, you need to put down a layer of coarse material to help encourage aeration. This can be anything such as sticks, corn cobs, vegetable stalks and other thick, fibrous matter. Then add weeds, grass and greens and your vegetables.
Will my compost bin attract rats?
If your compost bin attracts rats or mice, it’s because it’s too dry. Simply water it to deter vermin. That said, rats and mice will visit your compost bin if they’re in the area, which is why putting down a layer of chicken wire will help stop them from stealing any food waste you’ve recently added.

How to repressurise a boiler,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/repressurise-boiler/,"Bathroom, Kitchen","How to repressurise a boiler

In This Blog: What does repressurising a boiler mean? Why would you need to repressurise a boiler? How to repressurise a boiler How to repressurise a combi boiler How to repressurise a Worcester boiler How to repressurise a Baxi boiler How to repressurise a Vaillant boiler Boiler repressurising from someone you can trust How much does a new boiler cost to be installed by a professional? Which tradesperson should you use for the job? Boilers work tirelessly to provide us with a constant supply of warm water and keep our homes toasty warm. Given their essential nature, having a boiler lose pressure and performance at the worst possible time isn’t ideal. So, taking the time to learn how to repressurise a boiler is a wise choice.
Keep reading to discover how to repressurise a range of different boilers with step-by-step guides. We’ll also be covering the cost of a new or replacement boiler in case it’s time for you to upgrade. What does repressurising a boiler mean? Boilers are designed to control your central heating system, funnelling water throughout your home to warm your radiators and supply hot water to your taps. They’re essential to keeping things running smoothly but can start to lose pressure over time. Repressurising a boiler involves topping up the water level in your central heating system to allow it to function properly. Why would you need to repressurise a boiler? You can check your boiler pressure by looking at the gauge on the front of the boiler itself. There’ll be a needle that indicates the boiler pressure. If it’s low you’ve got a problem.
So, what are the reasons you may need to repressurise a boiler? There are two main causes of low boiler pressure, the first of which is that you have recently bled your radiators. This allows air to escape your system, lowering the pressure.
The second cause of low pressure is that you have a leak somewhere in your home. You should keep an eye out for any drips or damp patches throughout your property and if you find a suspected leak, call a professional to make the necessary repairs.

Find a boiler specialist near you  How to repressurise a boiler Ok, you may be wondering how to repressurise a boiler. Well, not every boiler is the same, so the process may be different for each machine. We’ll be exploring a few different methods to repressurise a boiler so you may prefer to skip ahead to the relevant section of this guide to save time.
First, we’ll be looking at how to use a filling key, which can be done as follows:
Verify that your boiler pressure is low by checking the needle on the front gauge.
Completely switch off your boiler and leave it for at least four hours to cool down.
Unclip the filling key from the tray below your boiler.
Next, push your key into the manifold keyhole, located adjacent to the manifold nut, and turn to unlock.
The pressure in your boiler should begin to rise. Wait till the gauge reads 1.5 bars before turning the key backwards.
Reclip your filling key to the underside of your boiler and push the tray back into place.
You can now turn your boiler back on.
Top tip: 
If the pressure in your boiler rises too much, you can bleed any of your radiators to reduce this. How to repressurise a combi boiler Combi boilers house a water heater and a boiler in one unit, meaning there’s no need for a large water tank. Water is heated as it runs from the water mains, making these boilers very efficient and space-saving.
Unfortunately, combi boilers can also lose pressure but don’t worry, the below steps will teach you how to repressurise a combi boiler using a filling loop:
As in the above section, make sure to completely switch off your boiler at least four hours before you start work to give it sufficient time to cool down.
Take a minute to check that both filling loop hose ends are properly attached.
Open both of your filling valves using their handles (you may need to use a screwdriver) to allow cold water to flood your system.
Watch the pressure gauge rise to between 1 and 1.5 bars before you close the filling valves again.
Finally, turn your boiler back on. How to repressurise a Worcester boiler Worcester is a fairly common brand of boiler but there are a range of different models available. Let’s look at how to repressurise a Worcester boiler using an external filling loop:
As always, start by switching off your boiler and allowing it to cool for at least four hours.
Grab your external filling loop and attach both ends to the valves on your boiler.
Open the taps on both valves letting water flow from the mains and enter your central heating system.
Carefully watch the gauge on your Worcester boiler and once the needle reaches just over 1 bar, switch off both taps.
Detach the external filling loop at both ends, being prepared for drips.
You can then switch your boiler back on and check it is functioning correctly. How to repressurise a Baxi boiler Learning how to repressurise a Baxi boiler will depend on the type of model you own. There are many different types of Baxi boilers, each with its own differences. How to repressurise a Vaillant boiler Vaillant is another popular brand of boiler. If you find your hot water or central heating system isn’t running as well as it should be, it may be time to learn how to repressurise your Vaillant boiler. You can check the pressure on your boiler by looking at its display panel. You’ll see one of two types of gauge; digital or physical.
As with other boilers, you’re aiming for a pressure of between 1 and 1.5 bars so if your boiler pressure is lower than this, you’ll need to top up the pressure. You can do this using the instructions earlier in this guide, but it’s likely you’ll need to use a filling loop as discussed in our ‘how to repressurise a Worcester boiler’ section.
Other types of boiler
As with any type of home appliance, boilers are available from a wide range of different brands. This can make it tricky to know exactly how to increase your boiler pressure if this falls below 1 bar. Thankfully your boiler should come with a manual that’ll cover how to do this. Boiler repressurising from someone you can trust If you’re struggling to repressurise your boiler don’t worry, our highly experienced members are here to help with any job no matter how big or small.

There you’ll find easy to read guides and articles full of essential advice for homeowners, buyers and sellers. How much does a new boiler cost to be installed by a professional? If you’re having issues with your boiler, it may be time to invest in a new one. Depending on the type of boiler you choose this can be quite expensive so it’s worth doing a little research to find the best boiler for your home. With a wide range of boilers on the market, things can get a little confusing. Take a look at our  new boiler cost guide  for more information.

Find balcony experts your neighbours recommend  How much does it cost to repair a leaking balcony? Since a balcony is outside, where it is exposed to the elements, it needs to be waterproofed. Waterproofing helps keep the balcony structure from degenerating because of water damage.
The process requires you to cover your concrete or wood balcony with a layer of material that keeps water out.
However, certain problems can cause the waterproofing layer to deteriorate or become ineffective. These can be:
Water pooling on the balcony floor, due to poor drainage or an irregular surface
Handrails, balustrade tops, or connection points not sealed properly
Warped beams causing the balcony to bow
In these cases, you may first need to repair the cause of the leak before you waterproof your balcony. However, waterproofing alone can cost about 
£20 per m2
. If you’re waterproofing a larger area, you may pay around 
£25 per m2
. For a smaller area, the cost could go down to 
£18 per m2
. Balcony repair quotes If you’re trying to find out how much your balcony repair will cost, you will need to contact a balcony installer in your area for quotes. We suggest you approach at least three such tradespeople for price estimates so you can get the best rate.
If you aren’t sure where to start, you could use our ‘ Request a quote ’ tool to make life easier. Just enter the details of the job and post it. We’ll send it on to our members who come recommended by your neighbours. You’ll then be contacted by balcony installers with their quotes. FAQs How much does it cost to make a balcony?
Making a balcony will cost you between 
£1,450 
and 
£5,075 
to make a small balcony. But this depends on the kind of materials you’ll use, labour, its size and design during construction. Bear in mind that materials and labour contribute to half of the total cost.
Also, you’ll need  planning permission to build a balcony , so be sure to check with your Local Planning Authority before building one.
How long does a balcony last?
If you care for it properly, a balcony should last many years. A concrete balcony can easily last for 50 years or more. How do I check if my balcony needs repairs? If your balcony has cracks in the concrete, especially older and deeper cracks, it may mean your balcony needs repair. Discolouration could imply water damage. If your balcony rails are rusted or move when you apply force on them, it could mean they are not as secure as they should be. This can be dangerous and would need fixing immediately.
What is a false balcony? Juliet balconies  are often called false balconies because they don’t project out.

Which tradesperson should you use for the job? Time to take the plunge The health benefits of swimming are vast, with both mental and physical advantages. Swimming can help to reduce anxiety, strengthen your body, and even improve your cardiovascular health. Owning a swimming pool is a dream for many homeowners so why not make this a reality and learn how to build a swimming pool at home?
Today, we’ll be covering the steps for building a swimming pool in your garden, plus tips on how to build a cheap swimming pool. We’ll even be looking at the costs of building a pool. So, keep reading to make your dream a reality. The benefits of building your own swimming pool If you’re lucky enough to have the space, building your own swimming pool will help to enrich your life in a variety of different ways. In addition to health benefits, owning a swimming pool is a fantastic way of adding value to your home and building something that will benefit every member of your family.
Below are some of the brilliant benefits of building your own swimming pool:
Save on the cost of labour:
 If you plan to build your own swimming pool you’ll save on the cost of labour.
Great for relaxing
: Swimming is ideal for unwinding after a hard day. It helps reduce mental stress and muscle tension, allowing you to relax.
Good exercise
: Perfect for anyone who struggles to exercise on land, swimming doesn’t put a strain on your joints like other types of activity. In fact, swimming can help you to reach a healthy weight, tone your muscles, strengthen your heart, and increase your endurance.
Fun for parties and socialising
: What better backdrop for a party than owning your own swimming pool. You can socialise with your guests while exercising together or even playing games in your pool.
Keeps the kids entertained
: Any parent knows the challenge of keeping kids busy during school holidays. Having a swimming pool gives them a constant source of entertainment while keeping them fit and healthy. Just make sure they’re always monitored for safety.
Great for cooling down on a hot day
: During the summer there’s nothing better than cooling off in your own swimming pool. Preparation for building a swimming pool in the UK The first step when learning how to build a swimming pool in the UK is planning. First, you’ll need to choose a perfect location. This can be anywhere on your property that’s clear of trees and bushes, is flat, gets the right amount of sunlight, and is easy to access for excavation vehicles.
Next, consider the size and shape of your new pool. Decide how deep you want the pool to be, where you’ll place exits and pick a size and shape that fits well within the space.
You’ll also need to choose what material your pool will be built from. You can choose from concrete, fibreglass, and vinyl lined options. However, bear in mind that concrete pools take the most time to install.
It’s also important to know the risks of building a pool. This is not a job for a DIY beginner, in fact, you could cause damage to your home or garden and injury to yourself if you don’t know what you’re doing. We’d always recommend hiring a professional to tackle the more challenging parts of this project like operating heavy machinery and large vehicles.

Find a trusted local pool company  How to build a swimming pool step-by-step Unfortunately, swimming pool construction is not a quick, easy job. The whole process can take anything from weeks to months, so be prepared for this when starting your swimming pool journey.
Wondering how to build a swimming pool step-by-step? Below are the main stages to follow:
Mark out the shape and size of your swimming pool.
Dig a hole to the correct dimensions of your pool. You’ll need to use an excavator, which we wouldn’t recommend operating yourself if you don’t have prior experience and training.
Even out the bottom of the hole you’ve just excavated by adding a layer of washed gravel subsoil and raking, then flattening it down.
Use steel supports to create a grid covering the sides and base of the hole.
Lay out the plumbing required for your swimming pool. This includes filtration, circulation systems and drains.
Add the electrics that will power your pool. Working with electrics is very dangerous so hiring an electrician is the safest option here.
For concrete pools, pour the concrete so it covers the walls and base of your hole, then grade and flatten while wet.
For fibreglass pools, position the structure using a crane, then fill in the area around the pool with concrete and soil.
For vinyl lined pools, first, pour the concrete as described in step 7 then lay the sheet covering the space. The vinyl will need to be stretched to allow a smooth covering, then tacked into place before any air is removed using a vacuum.
Finally, fill your new pool with water, then add chlorine and any other essential chemicals to keep it clean and kill any bacteria. Considerations for building a swimming pool in your garden When considering how to build a swimming pool in your garden, you’ll need to look at how this addition will fit into your outside space.
You’ll of course need to sacrifice a large portion of your garden, so this may not be the best choice for smaller outside spaces. Having said that, installing a pool can hugely enhance the appearance and usage of your garden. You can even build a deck around the pool with loungers, making this a stunning feature. Advice on building a concrete swimming pool Now we know how advantageous a pool can be, let’s look a little closer at how to build a concrete swimming pool.
Concrete is a great choice for your pool as it’s durable and long-lasting. It can also be poured into any shape you desire. One of the downsides of using concrete is the time it takes to install. It’s likely it could take up to 12 weeks for your pool to be finished. How to build a cheap swimming pool While swimming pools are a luxury not many can afford, it’s possible to learn how to build a cheap swimming pool. For those on a budget who want all the benefits owning a pool can bring, the following ideas should help you realise your dream while saving money:
Surround a large paddling pool with  raised decking  to give the appearance of an inground swimming pool.
Build a  natural swimming pool  by digging a hole in your garden and filling it with water. You’ll need to line the sides and base of the pool with clay or another type of liner so the water stays in place.
Buy an old shipping container or  skip  and once it’s thoroughly cleaned, coated and cushioned, just add water and a ladder and enjoy.
Purchase an above ground pool then dig a hole large enough to fit the pool in your garden. You can then position your pool in the hole, creating the effect of an inground pool.

Find a trusted local pool company  How to build an indoor swimming pool Building an indoor swimming pool is a little different to an outdoor pool as this will be built into the floor of your home. It’s essential this is done by someone with the proper training and experience to prevent issues down the line.
Below we’ve outlined how to build an indoor swimming pool:
Excavate a hole in the right shape and size to accommodate your new pool. Choosing the right position is vital to ensure you don’t damage your home’s foundations and structural integrity or any pipes and wiring.
Lay out steel supports to reinforce the walls and floor of your pool.
Add any plumbing and electrics such as lighting, filtration, heating and circulation.
Cover the sides and base of the hole with concrete and allow it to cure.
Add a layer of waterproof coating to the concrete.
Lay tiles covering the walls and floor of the concrete base to create a smooth surface for swimming.
Finish by adding water and chemicals. How to build a deck around a swimming pool The best way to enhance your new swimming pool is to build a deck around it. This will give you space to add loungers and tables for relaxing and holding drinks, as well as helping the pool fit seamlessly into your garden.
If you’d like to know how to build a deck around a swimming pool yourself, the below articles will guide you through the process. They also have guidance on professionals who can help: How to build a raised deck How to lay decking How much does it cost to build a swimming pool? If adding a swimming pool to your property sounds like a brilliant idea, you’ll need to know how much to budget. Whether you choose to save the money first or take out a loan, swimming pools are not cheap to install. If you’re on a tight budget, jump back to our ‘how to build a cheap swimming pool’ section.
Otherwise, check out our  swimming pool cost guide . It’s flooded with information and advice plus a range of different prices.
Looking for average costs? As a rough guide, the average indoor swimming pool installation cost will be 
£115,000
 and the cost of an outdoor pool will be 
£85,000
. Which tradesperson should you use for the job? When it comes to building an outdoor swimming pool, you’ll need to either hire a swimming pool installation company who’ll take over the entire project, or you could hire separate tradespeople. If you go down the second route you may save money, but this also comes with the hassle of working with a variety of professionals and project managing the work.
You’ll need the help of an electrician, a plumber, a contractor… the list goes on. So, to save time, use our free  request a quote feature  which will instantly send your enquiry to three local specialist tradespeople. Time to take the plunge Making the decision to hire an expert to install your pool is a brilliant choice. In addition to saving you weeks of work and a lot of energy, using a professional is the best way to guarantee a high-quality finish. You’ll also avoid any risks and dangers involved with doing the work yourself.
One of the best ways to find a tradesperson you can trust is to  search our website . All our members are fully checked, giving you the confidence you’re hiring a reliable tradesperson for your project. Plus, you can view past customer reviews before making your decision on who to choose.

Checkatrade reveals the highest rated trade experts across the North East of England
Checkatrade has revealed the top tradespeople across the North East of England, as decided by the consumers who used them.

The top five trades from the North East based on the best average review score across the following categories include:
Builders 
“What a transformation! Quality doors supplied by RP Home improvements. The craftsmanship is second to none. Not only were doors replaced for oak, but actually fit and operate better than previous. Obviously showing the difference between a new house builder/fitter and a knowledgeable and skilled craftsman. One very pleased customer. Thank you!” –

One of the best things for me was that they were an absolute pleasure to have around – two genuinely lovely guys.” –

They have totally transformed the way the roof line looks from an eyesore to something that is a pleasure to see. The area was left cleaner than when they arrived with all rubbish taken away. Anthony is trustworthy and a first-class tradesman hence the reason I get him to do all my repairs.” –

Worst home décor fails of the last 50 years,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/news/worst-home-decor-fails-of-the-last-50-years/,Tag Not Found,"Worst home décor fails of the last 50 years

With 1990s interiors fan favourite Changing Rooms re-booted and back on screens,  Checkatrade  is shining a light on some of the most questionable interior décor trends of the last 50 years revealing which should firmly be left in the past.
Polling 2,000 UK adults, the study uncovered inflatable furniture (23%), furry photo frames (22%) and animal hide rugs (20%) as the worst interior faux pas of the last half century. Meanwhile, bright purple walls as seen in Monica’s and Rachel’s apartment in 
Friends
 were also frowned upon by 16% of people.
And whilst there have been many questionable interiors trends over the years, 24% unashamedly admitted to having flowery wallpaper in their homes, along with lava lamps (24%) and patterned sofas (19%).
Worst interior design trends of the last 50 years:
Questionable interiors trends of the last 50 years we’ve had in our homes:
Inflatable furniture – 23%
Flowery wallpaper – 24%
Furry photo frames – 22%
Lava lamps – 24%
Animal hide rugs – 20%
Patterned sofa’s – 19%
Water beds – 17%
Reclining armchairs – 17%
Bright purple walls – 16%
Shap carpets/rugs – 16%
Additionally, it’s not just 
Friends’
 Joey and Chandler who have a love for lazy boy style reclining armchairs, so do one in ten people who think the furniture should return to popularity in British homes today. Whilst a further 10% want the lava lamp to see a resurgence as it did in the 1980s and 1990s.
The return of ‘90s décor trends
With many homeowners looking back on their childhood and family life with rose-tinted nostalgia, it also sees the return of ‘90s interior trends. From parquet flooring through to wicker and rattan furniture, over a quarter (26%) believe that social media has reintroduced old trends to new generations with 25% also admitting that design trends seem to be a copy of eras past rather than something new. Additionally, 23% believe that because 90s fashion is back, so too are design trends of the same decade whilst 22% simply feel we’ve run out of ideas.
‘’Whilst interior trends come and go, our research has found almost a fifth of people (18%) will redecorate their homes once every two to three years just to keep up to date with the latest trends,’’ said Mike Fairman, CEO of Checkatrade.‘’With shows like Changing Rooms back on air, it may encourage homeowners to give their home a new lease of life, and through Checkatrade you’ll be sure to find inspiration as well as recommendations you can rely on, the next time you need a tradesperson.’’
Popular 90s homes re-imagined
With so many popular programmes and films coming out of the ‘90s, just how influential were they to our home décor? In fact, despite the amount of damage Kevin McCallister caused on his family home during 
Home Alone
, 17% wish to live in the grand McCallister house most, followed by the Banks family mansion seen in 
The Fresh Prince of Bel Air
 (16%) and Monica and Rachel’s homely apartment in 
Friends
 (15%)
So, what would some of the nation’s favourite 90s sitcom rooms look like today? Checkatrade have given some a modern-day make over including:
The living room in Monica & Rachel’s Apartment, Friends
The popular purple walls of the ‘90s comedy have been given a modern lick of colour with the patterned sofas gone and replaced with neutral colouring.
The patterned curtains and lamp shades have also been updated with modern shutters and a director’s lamp. Whilst the iconic artwork remains above the TV, there is a flat screen TV to reflect modern times along with more greenery in keeping with today’s popularity of indoor plants.
The living room in the Banks family home, Fresh Prince of Bel Air
From Carlton infamously dancing to Tom’s Jones’ ‘It’s Not Usual’ through to Jeffrey ‘winning’ the lottery, the Banks living room has seen many a moment in the popular series.
The 90s living room has a bright and open feel, with a curved staircase in the background and chic 90s furniture. Today, the living room’s neutral palette has been refreshed to a bolder yet opulent colour, with velvet sofa, drinks cabinet and a more modern staircase.
Edina’s basement kitchen, Absolutely Fabulous
Arguably one of the most famous kitchens on British TV, this reimagining is based on Eddie’s original kitchen as seen in the earlier seasons of the comedy.
Known for its wooden cabinetry, the kitchen has been replaced to reflect a shaker style complete with marble bench tops.
Updated lighting above the island has also been included along with a wine fridge filled with Bollinger ready for Eddie’s and Patsy’s next escapade.

The guide to hiring the best house cleaner,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/hiring-guides/house-cleaner/,"Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living Room","The guide to hiring the best house cleaner

In This Blog: What is a house cleaner? Tips on how to find a house cleaner Questions to ask a house cleaner Why you should hire a house cleaner FAQs What should I know before hiring a house cleaner? Is it worth it to hire a house cleaner? How do you prepare for a cleaning person or team? Do you stay home with the house cleaner? Wondering how to find a good house cleaner? Finding a trustworthy cleaning service can be an intimidating process. What if they don’t turn up? Can you trust them around your children and pets? Will they do a great job, or will they spend time watching TV and invading the fridge instead?
With so many professional cleaning services available, it can be tricky to know what type of cleaner you need and to know what questions to ask to make sure you hire the perfect person or team.
We’ve pulled together some top tips on how to hire a house cleaner for your home. What is a house cleaner? A house cleaner is someone who maintains the cleanliness of your home regularly. A cleaner’s job includes the following:
Deep-cleaning and cleansing countertops, sinks, wall interiors, and exteriors, bathtubs, toilets, and floors.
Cleaning kitchens thoroughly, including countertops, sinks, drawers, cupboards, the inside and outside of appliances, light switch covers, the interior and exterior of microwaves and ovens, mopping, and hoovering, cleaning chairs and tables.
Sanitising, polishing, and cleaning toilets, bathrooms, bathtubs, sinks, showers, stainless steel, chrome, brass, and drains.
Scrubbing windows and sills.
Hoovering and steam-cleaning carpets and furniture.
Mopping, hoovering, and sealing floors of all kinds.
Dusting doors, picture frames, light fixtures, baseboards, furniture tops, and cupboards. Tips on how to find a house cleaner Hiring a cleaning service involves specific processes. Before letting a domestic cleaner into your house, it’s worth thinking about what makes a good cleaner. The best type of cleaner would be one that:
Turns up on time
Is friendly
Fantastic at cleaning, of course!
Trustworthy
Flexible
Respects you
Has a full understanding of cleaning
Knows how to use dangerous cleaning products safely
Goes the extra mile, e.g. spends a little more time scrubbing stubborn marks
Keeps up high cleaning standards, week after week
Boasts attention to detail (they can often spot things you can’t)
Shameless self-promo – use Checkatrade
On Checkatrade, you’ll find hundreds of professional cleaners and cleaning companies, all with relevant experience, insurance, and qualifications. All of our checked members have been checked and checked again by us. But, best of all, they’ve been reviewed by your neighbours.
Use our handy
 request a quote tool
 to find trustworthy domestic cleaners near you.

Find cleaners your neighbours recommend 
Request references
Avoid skipping this step. CRB checks are paramount when there are vulnerable adults and children in your house. So, you need to know who you’re letting inside and that they’ve had the appropriate background checks carried out.
This is particularly important if you’re trusting them with your house key and allowing them to access your home when you’re not there.
Ask the cleaner to run through the process with you
So that your cleaner can give a more accurate quote, they should be able to do a walkthrough with you and come and view your home before you agree to their services.
Check how your cleaner charges
While some house cleaners charge by the hour, others offer a flat rate per job. If you pay a cleaner per hour, they shouldn’t leave your property earlier if they claim they’ve “completed all the tasks.” So, if you’ve paid them for three hours, they must stay for the entire three hours. Questions to ask a house cleaner If you’re wondering how to find a good house cleaner, be sure to ask the agency questions to make sure you’re getting the best level of service from the cleaner.
Here are some examples of questions you can ask upfront:
How much will it cost?
How long will the cleaning take?
How do you take payment?
Are there any extra costs? Hiring a cleaner less regularly will require more costs per visit.
What days can your cleaner come?
Does the cleaner bring their own cleaning tools and equipment? If they’ll be using yours, how will they leave the tools? For instance, will they leave cleaning cloths in the sink on departure? Would they prefer you to provide particular types of cleaning products?
Will they let you try them out as a one-off before you commit to a more frequent arrangement?
Are there any tasks your cleaner won’t carry out? For instance, when it comes to corporate cleaners, they usually have policies in place where they can’t climb ladders.

Find cleaners your neighbours recommend  Why you should hire a house cleaner In today’s hectic world, upkeeping your property can be tough – because we’re busier than ever, right? Whether it’s work-filled schedules or family responsibilities, it’s no surprise we find it tricky to find time for ourselves. And even if you’re a stay-at-home-parent, why should you spend all your time housekeeping when you could reach out to a domestic cleaning service?
To help lighten the load, you can hire a house cleaner to assist you with everyday errands. You can choose more specialist house cleaning services to handle trickier tasks like oven cleaning, deep cleaning, and carpet cleaning.
Experts guarantee professionalism
As well as their knowledge and abilities, house cleaners also have the know-how. House cleaners offer you the highest quality service. Professional domestic cleaners will provide you with service of the highest standard.
Arrange frequent visits
A lot of house cleaners provide their customers with the option to sign a contract. In doing so, you can choose how often your cleaner visits your house and guarantee regular appointments on specific days. This enables you to plan your daily life and other activities.
You get back your free time
Recruiting the help of a house cleaner gives you a chance to concentrate on more essential tasks in your week rather than spending your free time cleaning your home. Instead of sacrificing your weekend dealing with this exhausting task, you could leave it to a professional.
Your house always looks spotless
When you’re too busy, ill, or have unexpected guests, it’s impossible to clean your home. Leaving the cleaning to a professional house cleaner ensures your property is always impeccably clean.

Find cleaners your neighbours recommend  FAQs What should I know before hiring a house cleaner? Here are some things to know before hiring a house cleaner:
Will you pay your cleaner hourly or a flat rate?
What tasks will you need them to carry out?
Will they do a trial period for you?
What boundaries and expectations do you have?
Are you/they flexible? For example, can you/they be flexible when it comes to the school holidays?
Put personal belongings such as unclean underwear and medication away
Let them know if you have children or pets Is it worth it to hire a house cleaner? Yes, hiring a house cleaner is well worth the cost. If your life’s hectic and you’ve always craved ditching the vacuum for some free time, this may be reason enough to reach out to one. It doesn’t cost the earth – have a look at our
 house cleaning cost guide
 to find out more about prices. How do you prepare for a cleaning person or team? You can prepare for a cleaning person or team by tidying up and picking up your clutter. This will save the cleaner spending a lot of their time shifting your things from one place to another. Do you stay home with the house cleaner? Many homeowners prefer to leave their property when the cleaner comes. This can help your cleaner work more efficiently because they won’t feel like they’re being watched all the time. If you do decide to stay while they do their job, you may get in their way.
If you feel uncomfortable about leaving the house, consider setting up a home security system so you can keep an eye on them. It doesn’t cost a lot – for an accurate guide on getting one erected, visit our

Unfortunately, they don’t have to install one if you use gas.
However, a  gas boiler too can put you at risk of carbon monoxide poisoning . That’s why it’s always a good idea to look into getting a carbon monoxide alarm yourself if you don’t have one in your home. Carbon monoxide alarm installation cost Cost provided item

In every room through which a flue from one of these appliances passes
In any room that you spend time in during the day and in any room that you sleep in at night Can I install a carbon monoxide alarm? Yes, you can install a carbon monoxide alarm yourself.

If in doubt, recruit the help of a trusted local professional – we advise  getting at least three quotes .

Find alarm experts your neighbours recommend  How do you fit a carbon monoxide monitor? You’ll need to fit your monoxide monitor up high on a shelf in a room together with a fuel-burning appliance. Installation involves several screws, while other types require zero installation as they’re freestanding. It shouldn’t take any more than a couple of minutes to fit but speak to a carbon monoxide specialist if you need help with this. Carbon monoxide alarm installation quotes Installing carbon monoxide detectors doesn’t cost the earth, but you need to keep everyone in your household safe. While it’s easy to install one yourself, it’s much better to leave such a crucial task to a professional who’ll know just what to do.
We advise obtaining three quotes for your job that you can do easily by using our  request a quote form . Just fill it in, and we’ll send the details to tradespeople near you. FAQs What is carbon monoxide? Carbon monoxide (CO) is unscented, colourless, and flavourless. This hazardous gas is often a silent killer, produced when a carbon-carrying fuel (coal, natural gas, wood, petrol, charcoal, or kerosene) – doesn’t completely burn.
Using a fuel-burning appliance like a fireplace or stove causes CO emissions. The only way to identify carbon monoxide in the air is by fitting a specialist alarm. It’s important to take  gas safety  seriously in the home to protect you, your property, and anyone else living inside. Do I need a carbon monoxide detector with a combi boiler? If you’ve had a modern combi boiler fitted, it’ll most likely be room-sealed. In other words, all waste air is taken outdoors, so it’s very unlikely it’ll reach you. That said, you may want to have one fitted just in case. How long do hardwired carbon monoxide detectors last? Hardwired carbon monoxide detectors typically last between five to seven years. You should replace your detector once it’s 10 years old. If the alarm doesn’t make any noise following monthly testing or it chirps once you’ve replaced the battery before its 10-year mark, replace it. How often should I change the battery in my carbon monoxide alarm? Change the batteries in carbon monoxide alarms at least every six months. Even though you replace your batteries, these types of alarms don’t last a lifetime. However, if your alarm uses Lithium-ion batteries, you’ll’ need to change them once every five years. Otherwise, you should change them once a year.

In This Blog: Sub floor ventilation installation cost What is a sub floor void? Passive air vents cost What are sub floor ventilation airbricks? Positive pressure ventilation system cost Sub floor ventilation installation quotes FAQs How do you calculate sub floor ventilation? Does a suspended floor need ventilation? If you’ve been ventilating your house properly and you’re still getting damp and moisture damage in your floorboards, it could be that you need to improve your sub floor ventilation. The installation cost isn’t very high, and it will help you keep damp and moisture out.
As a homeowner, you’d be constantly fighting against damp. If it’s allowed to settle anywhere, it will end up causing problems. Damp can get into wood, plaster, fabric and slowly degrades them or causes rot and mould. You and your family may even start facing health issues.
Fortunately, once you’ve determined that it’s your sub floor void that’s causing the problem, sub floor ventilation installation costs are quite affordable. And, it doesn’t take much time to install. Sub floor ventilation installation cost Cost provided item

£770 – £1,000
, while fitting 7 air bricks costs can range anywhere from 
£450 – £1,200
.
Unfortunately, you can’t foresee these kinds of expenses, but you can’t postpone getting the mould and rising damp fixed until you have sufficient funds. It’s vital to stop this as soon as possible to prevent floor moisture from causing a lot of harm fast.
To find a solution to best suit you, it’s best to speak with ventilation experts – you can find ventilation professionals that your neighbours recommend easily by searching your postcode here on Checkatrade.

See who your neighbours recommend for the job  What is a sub floor void? A sub floor void is the region underneath a ground floor, suspended timber floor. The size of this region varies considerably from zero, in which floor joists touch the substrate underneath, to an object you can crawl beneath. Usually, its actual size is roughly 300-400mm in depth (from the floorboards’ undersides to the substrate underneath). Find out more about  the cost of floor insulation  by heading to our expert guide. Passive air vents cost If you need an air vent but without moving parts or any noise, passive air brick’s a great option. What’s more, it doesn’t cost anything at all to run it and they’re incredibly straightforward to install, not to mention small and fast. The cost of passive air vents starts from around 
£20
 and is designed to reduce, if not eliminate, condensation and mould. What are sub floor ventilation airbricks? Sub floor ventilation airbricks are a special kind of brick featuring holes to enable the circulation of fresh outdoor air underneath suspended floors and inside cavity walls to stop moisture from accumulating due to damp or cold air resting in empty spaces or voids. Positive pressure ventilation system cost You can expect to pay around 
£400 
to have a positive pressure ventilation system installed by a trusted floor installer, however, costs can go right up to
 £500
, while on the lower pricing scale, you can pay 
£300
.

See who your neighbours recommend for the job  Sub floor ventilation installation quotes Finding a tradesperson shouldn’t be difficult. We’re here to help – we always advise getting at least three quotes from our trusted tradespeople.
Our  request a quote  feature is great for getting quotes from the tradespeople all your neighbours are talking about. Simply post details about the job you want doing and we’ll send it out to local tradespeople in your area. FAQs How do you calculate sub floor ventilation? You can calculate sub floor ventilation using the below formula:
Multiply subfloor length x width x height
This will give you your sub floor ventilation area in metres squared. Does a suspended floor need ventilation? Yes, because ventilation prevents the build-up of moisture within the floor structure.

How to remove a broken key from your lock,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/remove-broken-key-from-lock/,"Conservatory, Garage","How to remove a broken key from your lock

In This Blog: Removing a broken key from a lock – security & safety first How to remove a broken key from a lock Removing the broken key from the lock What not to do when removing a broken key from a lock When to call a locksmith to remove a broken key from a lock? FAQ’s Having to remove a broken key from a lock is up there as one of the tasks we all hope we won’t ever have to do.
In this guide, we look at what to do and what not to do to remove a broken key from a lock. Removing a broken key from a lock – security & safety first Safety must always come first. If your key has broken in the lock, did this happen with the door locked or unlocked? If the door is locked and the key has snapped off with no part sticking out of the lock, then the lock is ever so slightly more secure, but understandably most people will not feel happy leaving it this way for any length of time.
If the key snapped off before locking the door then you should resolve the situation immediately.
In a situation where children or medication are inside a locked property and the key has broken, or you are in an emergency then it is advisable to call an emergency locksmith in your area to avoid any delay.

Find locksmiths your neighbours recommend  How to remove a broken key from a lock Tools you’ll need to remove a broken key from a lock
In an ideal situation, you would have a broken key extractor to hand. If you’re here reading this though, chances are you don’t. Not to self, buy or order one from your local hardware shop! The following tools and items will come in handy:
Spray Lubricant – ideally an oil-free, silicone-based spray
Pliers
Needle-nose tweezers or pliers
Jigsaw or hacksaw blade
If you don’t have an oil-free or silicone-based lubricant you can use WD-40 but it is not ideal and could result in clogging up the locking mechanism.
Other useful items:
Flathead screwdriver
Steel wire or paper clips
Bobbybin or hair grip Removing the broken key from the lock If you have a broken key extractor kit then now is the time to use it. There is usually an assortment of long thin tools in this kit to use to slide down the side of the key to help to pull it out.
If you don’t have a kit and you’re attempting to remove the key with the tools mentioned above then try the following:
 If you can still see part of the key
 – spray some lubricant into the lock and using the pliers, pull on the exposed end of the key to try and pull it out.
Using super glue to stick something to the end of the key is the last resort so don’t attempt this unless you’ve tried other methods first.
If you can’t see part of the key
 – again, spray lubricant into the lock. Slide the hacksaw or jigsaw blade into the lock with the serrated edges pointing down and try to drag the key out of the lock. Depending on the size and shape of your hacksaw blade it can help to snap off the end part of the blade so you have a thin edge to insert into the lock.
If you don’t have a blade then you can attempt this with the needle-nose pliers or tweezers.
It may also be possible to try and use a flathead screwdriver to remove the broken key from the lock. If you have a flathead screwdriver that is small enough to fit into the keyhole, try inserting it in the lock.
You may be able to wiggle the screwdriver and pull it back towards you to loosen the key until you can see part of it emerging from the lock. Then you can use pliers to grab hold of the end of the key to remove the broken key from the lock.
If you have no luck with either of these methods after a couple of quick attempts then it is time to call a locksmith.

Find locksmiths your neighbours recommend  What not to do when removing a broken key from a lock Push the key in further
Use the wrong type or too much oil
This first point sounds very obvious, but in the moment when you might be panicking it’s easy to be too hasty and maybe even a bit clumsy. Take a moment to be calm, get your tools organised, and think through what you are going to do before rushing into it.
As mentioned above, WD40 is not recommended for removing a broken key in a lock, as too much oil can be counterproductive and actually clog up the locking mechanism. When to call a locksmith to remove a broken key from a lock? The situation is time-critical or happens at night time
Your lock cylinder is complex – trying to remove yourself may damage the lock
If you don’t have the tools to try yourself or are worried about damaging your door or the lock.
Hopefully, this is common sense, but if you find yourself in an emergency situation or your key breaks in the lock in the middle of the night, then calling a professional locksmith is the sensible thing to do.
Some door lock cylinders can be complex and trying to save money by removing a broken key from a door lock by yourself may end up costing you more.
Get an idea of how much a locksmith could cost by reading our  locksmith cost guide . FAQ’s Why do keys break?
Keys can break for a few different reasons, the main one is wear and tear. After a lot of repeated use, the teeth on the key can get worn down and catch in the lock, causing it to snap.
How to maintain a door lock?
A poorly maintained lock can also cause a key to snap, so it is a good idea to spray a silicone-based lubricant into the lock every 6 months. If you find that you have to use extra pressure to insert the key into the lock then consider getting a new set of keys cut.
Other things that can affect your door lock that you should check a couple of times a year are
Is your door hung correctly?
Are the door’s screws and strike plates aligned?
Test the latch and deadbolt.

How to choose an electric shower,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-choose-an-electric-shower/,Tag Not Found,"How to choose an electric shower

Cold, intermittent showers are a common problem for many homeowners and it often forces them to consider a new electric unit for their bathroom. Installing an electric shower means they never again have to stand around waiting for water to heat up, or worry about the hot water cutting out in the middle of a wash.
There is a huge variety of electric showers out there and this can make it difficult to decide what’s best for each home. As such, we’ve put together this handy electric shower guide to help you choose the right model.
How do electric showers work?
Electric showers include a heating element in the unit and rely on an electrical connection with a cold-water supply. Electricity fires up the heating element in the unit which warms water as it passes through towards the head unit. The end result is an almost-instant hot shower on demand.
Why should I recommend an electric shower?
The most obvious benefit is you don’t have to rely on the hot water tank supply. That said, there a several other advantages to purchasing an electric shower:
It minimises water and power usage, saving a lot of money on utility bills in the long run
You get a constant desired water temperature
Easy to install and fits into most plumbing systems
Offers great versatility with various controls available
How do I choose a good electric shower? 
There is a vast amount of choice when it comes to electric showers – each with a range of controls, styles, functions and pressure ratings available. We’ll run through all the different factors and features to consider so you can choose the best model for clients’ homes.
Choosing thermostatic controls 
Electric showers come with thermostatic controls for tweaking the temperature, and there are multiple types available:
Digital interface – display screen that can include a digital thermostat and various buttons for temperature control. These can also be touch screen.
Remote – Digital remotes can be used instead of the usual control attachments for a shower.
Dials – More traditional models come with dials for adjusting the temperature.
The type of controls you choose is up to the customer’s needs, so make sure you keep their preference in mind. They might prefer having more control functions on a touchscreen, or instead may want a less complicated interface with simple dials. Whichever you choose, look out for the higher quality showers which will do a better job of keeping the temperature steady when the controls are adjusted.
Environmentally friendly options
Some electric showers come with an eco setting to reduce water waste and power consumption. Homeowners can also save more money on their utility bills with these models. If this is important to a customer, try to avoid showers with a high wattage rating as these typically use more energy and water.
Temperature safety functions 
When choosing a shower, make sure it comes with built-in functions for temperature safety. The two features to look out for are:
A safety stop function — electric showers should have a safety function which stops the flow immediately if the water gets too hot
A high-temperature cap to prevent accidental scalding
Limescale protection features
Limescale build-up will damage the shower head and pipes, which can also affect a property’s water pressure in the long term. For this reason, you should choose a shower that is designed to prevent this from occurring. These models will usually have lengthened heating elements and wider coil gaps in the shower unit, so make sure you pay close attention to the specifications.
Water pressure
Each household has its own water pressure system that must be factored in when choosing an electric shower. You should ensure the shower is suitable for the level of water pressure in the pipes, otherwise the appliance wont function properly. For example, low-pressure systems may need an electric shower with an integrated pump to achieve a sufficient pressure level.
Shower heads
This will be based on customer preference, but keep in mind there is a range of shower heads to choose from with different functionalities. Some will have multiple spray patterns to switch between, while others come with eco performance options to help save energy and water.
Installation 
For the most part, electric showers are pretty easy to install, but you should still pay attention to some design features that can potentially cause problems. Look out for the number of water and cable entry points on the appliance, because just one or two entry points can make the shower more difficult to install. It could lead to rewiring problems or make it too impractical to install a shower in the desired position.
Also, check the wall fixings. Some showers will only have a wall fixing aperture at one end, meaning they’re only suitable for replacements instead of installations.
Steam
Electric showers produce large amounts of steam due to the way they heat water. This can create damp in the home so it’s best to purchase a model that minimises the amount produced, especially for clients with older properties that aren’t as insulated.
Best electric showers in 2021
There are hundreds of different electric shower models. To narrow it down and make your life easier, here’s a list of the best electric showers on the market today:
REDRING Pure
Mira Sport Max
Mira Azora
Bristan BL3105 B
Bristan Glee 3
Gainsborough Electric Shower
Aqualisa Quartz
Triton MOSV07SG Seville
Triton Martinique
Triton Kito
As well as shortlisting, always make sure to look at reviews to help you make your decision.
What wattage electric shower do I need?
Electric showers generally range between 5kW and 10.5kW ratings. They need this electrical power to generate water pressure and heat the water, resulting in a consistent temperature with strong water flow. Higher voltage means higher pressure, but keep in mind these models will be pricier. What’s more, not every home should install the most powerful electric shower. It’s best to purchase a shower with a wattage range that suits the size of the home’s water tank and the reliability of its water supply.
Here’s a guideline:
If the water supply is somewhat unreliable or the property has a small water tank, aim to buy in the 5kW-8kW range.
If there’s a large water tank and steady water flow in the home, you can choose from the 8kW-10.5kW range.
FAQs
Do electric showers need hot water? 
Electric showers heat the cold-water supply using electricity, so you don’t need hot water for it to operate.
Is a power shower the same as an electric shower? 
Power showers and electric showers operate differently when it comes to water supply. Only cold water is fed into an electric shower, whereas a power shower uses both hot and cold water from the home’s storage tank.
What size cable and pipe are required for an electric shower? 
The size of cable for an electric shower will depend on the wattage. That being said, it’s probably best to install a 10 mm² cable to avoid needing a larger one if the electric shower is replaced in the future.
Water pipes for electric showers are usually 15mm in diameter.
Do electric showers have pumps?
Although some models can be bought with a small internal pump, most electric showers don’t have one built in. That’s why you need to make sure the water mains pressure is performing properly.
Do I need an electric shower?
If members of the household take long showers in succession, they may find the water tank is running out of hot water too quickly. In this case, electric showers will be the way to go to ensure a steady supply. They also tend to be more environmentally friendly in terms of both energy and water consumption.
What is a good flow rate for an electric shower?
A flow rate of four litres per minute is considered the minimum for an adequate shower. Five litres per minute would be considered a good flow rate.
How much does it cost to run an electric shower?
This varies depending on the water provider, water flow and temperature. But as a guideline, you can expect the cost to be around 40p per 10 minutes running time. Power-wise, electric showers are slightly more expensive than traditional systems, but you have the benefits of faster heating, better water pressure and constant hot water.

Trade demand booms while supply chains suffer,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/news/tradespeople-supply-issues/,Tag Not Found,"Trade demand booms while supply chains suffer

There’s a high demand for tradespeople at the moment, which is a double-edged sword for our members. Although it’s great for them to be in high demand, they’re having to book jobs well into the future. This means that homeowners are waiting longer for their work to start or they’re taking the risk by using tradespeople with availability, rather than checking whether they’re qualified for the job.
How has this happened?
There are a few reasons. Some of the issues are a knock-on effect as a result of Covid-19 and Brexit. Also, there was, and continues to be, a large number of home renovation projects happening across the UK, primarily due to lockdowns and homeowners deciding to invest in their properties. Then there are the bottlenecks that occur with the lack of material supplies, which delays projects even further.
That said, even though it might be longer before our members can start your work, it’s well worth the wait. You can be comfortable in the knowledge our members are checked by us, reviewed by your neighbours, and then checked by us again. Even better, we  guarantee  their work!
Why are there material shortages?
There are many reasons for the current  material shortages . They’re mostly related to high demand, the pandemic, and Brexit.
Checkatrade CEO Mike Fairman said, “
The current global raw materials shortage has had a profound impact on the UK trade and construction industry. Soaring demand, the impact of Brexit, continued pandemic recovery and shock factors like forest fire threats in North America are all reasons behind the shortages we have seen.”
You can read more about the  material shortages and price rises here .
Why wait for the right tradesperson?
Despite the waiting times, it’s better to 
hold out for a reputable trade
 instead of hiring anyone who’s available. Although we understand the frustrations of waiting to get your dream home renovations started, you should always hire a tradesperson for their quality, not for their availability.
How can you check their quality?
Tradespeople have to pass stringent checks before we even consider them as one of our members. So, save yourself some time searching for the best tradespeople by searching for our members.
Even after a tradesperson passes our checks, we continue to check them to make sure they’re still great at what they do. Just one of those checks is of
 the reviews left by your neighbours
 to make sure they’re not fake.
Our 
NEW guarantee  is another benefit of using our service. We’re so confident in the quality of our member’s work that we’ll guarantee it for 12-months completely free, meaning you’re covered in the rare event that your job doesn’t go to plan. Find out more  here .
How to get your job completed
Here are some of the things you can do to speed up the process of booking in your job.
Make sure you approach the right tradespeople
It might sound obvious, but making sure you’re approaching the right person for the job is about doing your research. For example,  carpenters  and  electricians  cover a wide range of jobs within their roles.
It’s also a good idea to take a look at the trade’s previous work. That way you can see if the job you’re planning is something they specialise in. You can easily do this by taking a look at their profile on our site.
Give yourself options by requesting at least 3 quotes
The more quotes you request, the more likely you are to hear back from one of our members. Aim to look for local tradespeople as they will likely have local knowledge of local planning permission and supplier networks should your project need this information. They’ll also be close, which means they’re nearby in case any issues arise during your project.
Save time and effort, use our  request a quote  feature – be as detailed as possible in the form
When you’re looking for a reliable tradesperson or team, you can save a lot of time by putting as much information as possible into your initial enquiry. A great way to do this and get multiple quotes is to use our  request a quote  feature to post your job. Once you post the details, we do the searching for you.
Giving as much detail as possible in your request a quote form means our members get a good idea of what is needed for your project. They can then give accurate costs, a realistic start date, and a rough time to complete your project. It’s likely when they reply to your request a quote they will come back to you with additional questions and advice, a quote, or to book a time to come and visit you to discuss it more.
Request a quote is also great for matching you up with the right person/people for your project. Even better, 
once you post your job
, your job information is 
sent to three recommended members in your local area.
Conclusion
It’s worth waiting for one of our guaranteed Checkatrade members to take on your job
Make sure you thoroughly fill out the  request a quote  form to help improve your chances of contacting the right tradesperson/people for the job
Request a minimum of three quotes to increase your chances of a callback (easily done with  request a quote !)

Guide to bathroom water pressure,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/guide-to-bathroom-water-pressure/,Tag Not Found,"Guide to bathroom water pressure

If someone’s been living in a home for a while, it can be difficult to know if the bathroom water pressure has changed or if it’s at the level it should be. Homeowners often don’t realise their water pressure is too low or high, as it can feel normal if the change happens gradually over time.
That’s why it’s important to understand and check water pressure so you can ensure clients’ showers, baths and taps are working properly. This guide will take you through reasons the water pressure could be wrong, how to test bathroom water pressure and what’s needed to fix any issues you find.
What is water pressure and how is it affected?
Water pressure is how quickly water flows through the pipes for bathroom appliances, so it has a massive impact on the quality of showering and how fast a bath fills up. The force of the water is measured in bars, with one bar being enough to push water up to the height of 10 metres.
Water pressure systems are different for each property. It can even vary depending on the room and the time of day. During the morning, for instance, some might experience low water pressure in the bathroom because other houses in the area will be using their showers and baths at the same time.
Types of water pressure systems
There are three different types of systems that will influence water pressure supply and the standard measurement of water pressure in the bathroom. Understanding the system in a particular home will give you a better idea of what level the pressure should be running at.
Gravity fed heating system
This type of system is typically found in older homes, featuring a cold-water storage tank and a hot water cylinder. Gravity fed systems usually operate at quite a low water pressure, so expect bathroom taps and showers to be running at around a 0.2 bar rating.
Combi boiler system 
Combi boilers are fed with water from the mains pressure supply, which it then pumps around your home at about the same level of pressure as the mains. If a combi boiler system is in place, water pressure will be high. Taps and showers should normally be around 1-1.5 bar.
Unvented system 
Unvented water systems are made up of just a main cylinder, which is filled directly from the water mains and maintains a high pressure level. With this setup, bathroom appliances will be running at about 2 bars.
How do I find out my water pressure?
Now that you’ve got an understanding of what water pressure to expect in the bathroom, the next step is to find out the water pressure reading so you can compare.
Your first option is to get in contact with the water supplier as they’ll have the skills and equipment to deliver a precise reading for you. Alternatively, you can test the pressure yourself with a pressure gauge, which can be purchased online or at a plumbing outlet.
Here’s a step-by-step process to measuring bathroom tap pressure with a pressure gauge:
Ensure no water is running
Attach your gauge to the tap
Turn the tap on fully
Jot down the reading and compare it to your expected pressure rating
How can I test the water pressure for my shower?
There’s also a way you can work out if the shower pressure is working properly. This is without the use of a pressure gauge, however, so you’ll be calculating the water flow rate instead. While you won’t be able to get an actual pressure reading, this method still provides a good indicator of how the shower is performing. You’ll need a measuring jug, a calculator and a stopwatch to carry out this test.
Place your jug under the shower head
Turn on the shower and fill the jug for exactly six seconds using the stopwatch
Measure the amount of water in litres and multiply this by 10 which will give you the water flow rate per minute
Your measurement should fall into one of the following rankings. This will indicate the level of the water pressure in the shower:
Low flow rate = Less than 10 litres
Normal flow rate = 10-15 litres
High flow rate = More than 15 litres
Why is the water pressure low? 
After testing the bathroom appliances, you may find the water pressure is lower than it should be for that particular system. If this is the case, there are several factors you need to consider to help you diagnose the problem. These are the main causes:
Build-up of hard water deposits. These deposits can block the valve, aerator, pipes or showerhead.
Blocked pipes can affect bathroom water pressure. Blockages happen as rust and minerals clog the hot water output.
A leak may have occurred. This a serious incident that can damage the structure of the property.
If none of the above apply, there could be a problem with the water mains supply. This should be reported to the local water provider so they can fix the issue.
How do I increase water pressure in my bathroom?
There are a few ways you can increase bathroom water pressure should you discover it’s too low:
Clean or replace pipes –
 Clean and remove hard water scale and sediment build-up inside the plumbing lines. Or, replace the old pipework.
Correct taps and shower head – 
Make sure the taps and showers are suited to the water pressure system. For example, a tap that requires a high bar rating to function won’t perform properly with a low-pressure system.
Install a power shower –
 The appliance uses a built-in electric pump to provide a stronger jet of water.
Fit a shower pump –
 Shower pumps increase water pressure in the pipes before it comes out the shower head.
For more useful information on improving water pressure, check out our article  here .
What if my bathroom water pressure is too high?
High water pressure should be fixed quickly as it can pose many problems for a home, including:
Wasted water and more costly water bills
Plumbing leaks and subsequent damage
Shortened lifespan for a water heater
Boiler and piping damage
The root of the problem will usually be the water regulator which is found where the mains enters the home. You’ll have to tinker with the water pressure for the entire property rather than just the bathroom.
Adjusting a water regulator 
Best-case scenario, you’ll have to adjust the water regulator. Here’s how:
Locate the water mains valve and turn it off
Loosen the locking nut on the regulator using a wrench
Use a screwdriver to turn the screw on the regulator anti-clockwise in small increments. This will decrease the water pressure
Test the water pressure to see if it’s now in the correct bar range. If not, adjust the regulator again accordingly
Once you’ve achieved the right pressure level, secure the lock nut on your regulator
Turn the water mains valve back on
Replacing a water regulator
You’ll need to replace the valve if the regulator is no longer reducing water pressure. Here’s the step-by-step process:
Turn off the water at the mains and run a faucet to empty the pipes.
Grab hold of the pipe below the deice and turn it using a wrench.
The pipe and regulator should gradually separate, at which point you can remove the old regulator.
Place the new regulator into the pipe. Bear in mind you might need a pipe fitting if the regulator end is too large.
Next, tighten the pipe connected to the regulator to keep it in place.
Program or switch on the regulator and make sure it’s running at the desired level of water pressure.
Finally, turn the water mains back on and check there aren’t any leaks around the pipes.
Installing a water regulator
You may find that the property doesn’t even have a water regulator. It would be a good idea to install one to ensure water pressure is kept at a normal level. Regulators can be purchased for around £35.
FAQs
Is 2.5 bar water pressure good?
Whether this reading is good will depend on what water pressure system is installed in the home. You’ll need to compare what bar range is suitable for the property.
What does 3 bar water pressure mean?
As mentioned, water pressure is the force of the water moving through pipes and is measured in bars. This is enough force to raise water to a height of 30 metres. This is considered high.
What is the best water pressure for a tap or a shower?
The best water pressure for a tap or shower will depend on what water system the property has in place. Note, low water pressure only in showers might indicate a problem with the unit, while low pressure in bathroom taps is more likely to be down to a problem with the home’s plumbing network.

How to start a window cleaning business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/start-window-cleaning-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a window cleaning business

No matter how nice windows are at first, they all will get dirty over time, obscuring beautiful views and light flow. Returning those windows to their sparkling clean state is the job of a window cleaner and that’s where you come in. Wondering how to start a window cleaning business? Read on.
With the help of this guide, you’ll discover the best ways to get started in the busy world of window cleaning. We’ve also included tips to build a business plan, guidance on making your company profitable, and advice on the different start-up costs involved.
How to start a UK window cleaning business
Window cleaning is an essential but physically demanding job that is full of potential. The good news? This career path is open to anyone willing to work hard even those without years of experience.
However, you’ll need some training and practice before you strike out on your own and working as a window cleaner is the perfect way to get one foot on this career ladder.
Let’s look at how to start a UK window cleaning business. The following list covers some of the first steps to building your own company:
Ensure you have health and safety training if you’ll be using a ladder. Thankfully it’s no longer necessary to balance precariously on a ladder while cleaning windows but you’ll need to invest in a range of equipment to allow you to do your job from the ground.
Choose a unique company name and register this with Companies House. The name can be meaningful, unforgettable, and fun to help customers remember you.
Ensure you’re physically fit enough to properly do this job. If you plan to use a ladder, check out our  working at height guide  to help keep you safe.
Look at your competitors, what they charge, and how they market themselves in order to see where your company can fit into the industry. Look for gaps in the market where you can fulfil extra demand.
Research the industry and any new advances in technology like water-fed poles to ensure you’re offering your customers the best service.
Coming up with a window cleaning business plan
To help your company progress and reach its potential, you’ll need to come up with a window cleaning business plan. This will help you to attract investors and will be a document you refer back to time and time again while building your company.
Make sure to include the following points:
The market
Knowing the market and your customers well is the key to succeeding in any business. You need to ensure that your customers needs are being met by the services you offer to build good relationships.
It’s also key to know all about your competitors. You can look at their pricing, the services they offer, and work out how you’ll ensure customers pick you over them.
In order to attract customers, you’ll need to get your company name out there. You can do this through local social media groups, paid advertising, word of mouth, or handing out flyers. An alternate option available to anyone starting a window cleaning business is to  join Checkatrade  and benefit from the huge number of customer leads we receive regularly.
Finance
Managing a business well means paying attention to your finances.
Firstly, you’ll need to cover any start up costs; will you self-fund or take out a loan or credit card?
You also need to decide how you’ll price your services, look at how much your competitors charge for guidance, and ensure you’ll make a profit. If you have a head for numbers, you can even predict your earnings over time.
Keep track of any financial records including money coming in and going out of your account. This will help when it comes to paying taxes and National Insurance.
Confused? Don’t worry, running your company finances can be tricky and if that part of starting your business is something you need extra support with, we’d recommend hiring an accountant, undergoing training, or reading online guides for more details.
Business strategy
This is where you consider the logistics of your company. You need to look at what services you’ll offer, the hours you’ll work, the area where you’ll work, how you’ll source your tools and whether you’ll hire employees.
You’ll also need to decide how you’ll get from one job to the next. If you have a lot of equipment we’d suggest investing in a van.
Legalities and insurance
Starting a new business is a big commitment and you’ll need to make sure you operate within the law. This means registering with HMRC and paying the right amount of tax. It’s also well worth signing up for insurance to prevent any legal or financial issues affecting your company. Consider at least getting public liability insurance, business equipment insurance and van insurance.
How to grow a window cleaning business
You may need to start small when it comes to building your own business and this is very common. But once your company has found its feet you could consider expanding. This will help you to increase your profits and meet the needs of more customers.
Below, we’ve listed a few of the ways to grow your window cleaning business:
Better equipment
: Investing in new equipment is a great way of offering more and better-quality services. This means you can work more efficiently and charge more for your work.
Incentives:
 You can offer incentives to new customers when they sign up for regular window cleaning over a set period of time. This means more repeat work, allowing you to build your client base.
Hire new workers
: Unable to fulfil the demand for your services? Why not hire new employees to help expand your company?
New services
: Once you get to grips with owning a window cleaning business, you may want to consider offering other types of services to grow your company.
What do I need to start a window cleaning business?
You won’t need expensive equipment to get started in this industry, in fact, you may even already own some of the essentials. Having said this, if you plan to work from the ground rather than a ladder you’ll need extra tools like a water-fed pole to allow you to reach high windows.
So, what do you need to start a window cleaning business? At the bare minimum, your window cleaning business start-up kit should include:
Bucket
Ladder
Window cleaning detergent
Microfibre cloths
Squeegee
Scraper
Bucket belt
Remember, there are many other types of equipment that you should consider investing in if you want to grow your business and give your customers the best quality service. On a tight budget? No problem, just  join Checkatrade  to receive large discounts on all your business essentials through our Buyers Club.
FAQs
How much does it cost to start a window cleaning business?
Getting started in the window cleaning business is as easy as buying the basic equipment and driving to your customers’ homes. In fact, you could start out as a small company from as little as £100. Perfect if you don’t have any savings.
Of course, if you want to build a large business you’ll need to invest in more advanced equipment and marketing to reach more customers. You’ll also need a van to transport your equipment and insurance to protect your company in case of accidents or mistakes.
Is a window cleaning business profitable?
With low start-up costs and overheads, you can build a successful, small business no matter your financial situation. This means that a window cleaning business can be profitable right from the start. The amount you actually make will depend on the services you offer, your experience, your efficiency, the amount you charge and the demand in your area.
Thankfully, window cleaners will always be needed as most people are either too busy or physically unable to clean their own windows. Especially on upper floors.
How much can a window cleaning business make?
Again, this will depend on a range of factors, but as a rough guide, a window cleaner working alone can earn £200 a day. This means if you expand your company to include other employees you can earn more and more each day.
For more information, tips and prices, give our handy  window cleaning prices guide  a read.
How do you charge for window cleaning?
Working out how to charge for your services doesn’t need to be a stressful process. The best way to start is to look at how much your competitors charge to get a rough idea of what people are willing to pay in the area. You can then consider how your services stack up against your competitors. For example, if your services are better quality, or you offer less common services you can charge more.
When it comes to actually taking payment for your services you have a few options. You can ask for cash in hand, but make sure to keep a record of this. Otherwise, you can ask for a bank transfer or you can invest in a card machine. The right option will be personal to your company and needs.
Do you need a licence to be a window cleaner in England?
No, but you can consider getting accreditation from The Federation of Window Cleaners to show your customers you’re a legitimate business.
Useful checklist for starting a window cleaning business
Your business plan should include information on how you plan to market, run, fund, and protect your company.
Starting a window cleaning company isn’t too complicated and start-up costs will be anything from £100 upwards.
You can make a good profit by building your own window cleaning business as long as you offer a high-quality service and meet the needs of your customers. Joining Checkatrade  is a brilliant way to attract customers, save on business essentials and give your company credibility.
You don’t need to work on a high, dangerous ladder as the technology now exists to allow you to work from the ground.

How to start a window fitting business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/start-window-fitting-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a window fitting business

Windows play a variety of key roles in any building. From letting in sunlight, to offering stunning views and keeping the structure insulated, these panes of glass are multi-functional. What’s more, there’s no escaping the fact that we all depend on windows, making learning how to start a window fitting business a great choice.
Whether you have experience in this industry or are a newcomer, this guide is ideal to support your new business venture. You’ll learn how to put together a business plan, how to choose a company name, the different start-up costs involved and so much more.
First steps to start a window fitting business
Window fitting is an essential service that most homeowners will need at some point in their lives. This means becoming a part of this booming industry is a wise decision that’ll challenge you and enrich your life.
So, if you’re considering joining this sector where do you begin? It’s simple, just use the following tips to help you start your window fitting business:
Pick a great name that your customers won’t forget (more on this later) and consider branding for your company. You can also build a basic website to help you book appointments, show the products you sell and give answers to frequently asked questions.
Work out your target market. You could choose to work with retail business, at customer’s homes, or at business offices and picking a specialism can help to define your business.
Consider whether you can afford to start a new business right now. Thankfully start-up costs for a window fitting business aren’t too high (more on this coming up) but you’ll still need an initial investment.
Do you have the right experience and training to get started in this industry? Remember you can always hire workers to actually fit the windows, but you’ll need to pay them a fair salary.
Research your competitors and look for gaps in the market. For example, if there are no other businesses offering aluminium window frames in your area, this is a demand you can fulfil.
Speak to others in the trade for tips on how they got started and ask about common pitfalls you can avoid.
If you feel a little lost and need extra support, consider joining our  members community  where you can ask questions and get advice.
Decide whether you’ll offer free quotes. This may mean more customers choose your business, especially if your competitors don’t offer this service.
In order to bring in more customers, you could also offer repairs or window maintenance for a monthly fee.
How to start a window installation business
It’s true that competition in the window fitting business is high but the reason for this is that demand is also high. So, by no means does this mean there isn’t a gap in the market for you to fill.
The best way to start a window installation business with strong foundations is to put together a full business plan. Use the following sections to cover all the essential factors:
Customers first
Start by considering your target market, who they’ll be and how you’ll reach them. Try to find a gap in the market that you can fill to give your business a unique selling point. This will help you to meet the needs of more customers. You can also reach customers through advertising, social media or building a website.
If finding new customers is a concern, why not  join Checkatrade ? We’ll support you as your business grows with free marketing materials. In addition, you’ll benefit from the thousands of customer leads we receive every month. What better way to boost your new company?
Following the law
Every new business needs to ensure that everything is done above board. You’ll want to ensure you have the right licences and insurance in place before you start taking on customers. It’s also vital that you register with the HMRC and pay the correct amount of tax and National Insurance.
In addition, you should always keep hold of any invoices or receipts for tax purposes.
Running your business
Starting a window fitting business will see you making many different logistical decisions. These choices will give your company a detailed road map to follow.
You’ll need to decide how you’ll source new windows, if you’ll offer additional services, how far you’re willing to travel for jobs and if your van is large enough to transport windows, to name a few choices. Plus, you can always have windows delivered directly to your customers to make life easier for you.
Money talks
One of the most important aspects of starting a business is the financial side. We’ll be covering start-up costs in more detail later, but you need to plan how you’ll fund these. Will you save up the funds yourself, take out a loan, take out a credit card or ask for an investment? You also need to decide how much you’ll charge for your services and ensure you make a good profit.
Once your company is up and running you may decide to offer finance for your customers. This allows them to pay over time which can be a big draw. You can even work with a finance company in a mutually beneficial relationship to support your clients.
Coming up with window installation business names
When it comes to picking a window installation business name it’s ok to have a little fun. Staring a new company can be a lot of work so take this opportunity to play around with your different options. You could choose a window pun or a name that best suits your company values. Remember to make your business name memorable, catchy and unique.
FAQs
How much does it cost to start a window installation business?
Every business will require some kind of start-up costs and these will vary from business to business. So how much does it cost to start a window installation business? Well, you may be surprised to hear it’s actually quite affordable.
It’ll usually cost less than £10,000 but there are a few optional extra expenses you may wish to pay for. You’ll need:
A van
Tools
Insurance (skip ahead to the next section)
Marketing (optional) – Marketing can be quite costly depending on what route you go down.
Training (optional) – If you need extra training to allow you to do your job well, this is strongly advised.
If you’re running low on start-up funds, don’t worry. Becoming a  Checkatrade member  will allow you to use our Buyers Club where you can make huge savings on things like tools and insurance.
Window fitting business insurance
Getting insurance is always advised when starting any small business. If you’re unfortunate enough to have an accident or make a mistake when fitting windows, having insurance will protect you and your company financially and legally.
The following types of insurance are recommended when building your window fitting company:
Glaziers’ insurance Public liability insurance Personal accident insurance
Employers’ liability insurance (essential if you plan to hire employees)
Do you need a Licence to fit windows?
It’s important that you have the necessary licences and accreditations if you plan to fit windows for a living. Your clients will want to hire a professional who not only provides a high-quality service but also fits windows according to building regulations. It’s definitely worth getting FENSA registered so you can self-certify that your windows meet building regulations.
Useful checklist for starting a window fitting business
Get a head start on your competition by meeting the needs of your customers, offering a high-quality service and providing services that aren’t already covered in your area.
Most new businesses aren’t prepared for any legal action taken against them so getting insurance will protect you in case of any unsatisfied past customers.
Starting a window fitting business is relatively affordable so you won’t need a large investment up front.
Creating a business plan is the best way to hit the ground running when building your company. Joining Checkatrade  is the ideal way to increase your customer base and receive support when you need it.

How to connect CCTV to your TV wirelessly,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/connect-cctv-to-tv-wirelessly/,"Bedroom, Living Room","How to connect CCTV to your TV wirelessly

In This Blog: How to connect a digital video recorder (DVR) to a TV wirelessly How to connect using NVR (Network Video Recorder) How to connect using NetcamViewer monitor How to connect using streaming apps Advantages of using wireless CCTV Flexible Disadvantages to be aware of for using wireless CCTV FAQS How can I watch CCTV on my smart TV? How can I view my security cameras on my TV? How do wireless security cameras work? Unsure of how to connect your wireless security camera to your TV? First things first, it’s important to note that ‘wirelessly’ means you have wireless security cameras (IP cameras). This guide focuses on wireless cameras rather than wired cameras.
With the increasing popularity of IP cameras (Internet Protocol cameras) in our homes, more and more people want to understand how to install them correctly. While you may enjoy connecting and watching your surveillance cameras remotely using your mobile app, others prefer to watch their camera on a sizable TV screen; like a Sony TV, Samsung TV, or another kind of smart TV.
Connecting the CCTV to your TV wirelessly is by no means a walk in the park, but it isn’t impossible. Rigging up your CCTV system typically involves three straightforward techniques, which we’ll look at below.
If you’re connecting with a wire, you’ll be using an HDMI cable in your TV from the camera hub. However, you can use a smart TV app and use the wireless approach.
If you need help setting up your CCTV camera so it works with your TV, it’s best to get an experienced TV engineer or CCTV installer to help you with a personalised plan to ensure you’re up and running in no time. You can find out about prices in our guide to  professional CCTV installation costs .
When it comes to your and your family’s safety and security, it’s best to get advice or to work with a professional. You can easily 
find CCTV experts recommended by your neighbours
 here on Checkatrade.

Get help from installers recommended by neighbours  How to connect a digital video recorder (DVR) to a TV wirelessly There are several ways to plug your DVR into your television wirelessly, but the best way by far is doing this via the HDMI cable.
Step 1:
 Make sure you switch off your TV and DVR before you start.
Step 2:
 Plug one bit of the cable into the DVR. Attach one end of a standard HDMI cable to the HDMI 1 Out port (this is on the rear of the DVR box).
Step 3:
 Connect the other end of the same HDMI cable into the HDMI 1 In port (you’ll see this either on the side or reverse of your TV).
Step 4:
 To connect the two appliances, switch on the TV and DVR. Turn your TV to the appropriate HDMI input source to use the DVR. To change the input setting, push your remote control or TV’s ‘Input’ or ‘Source’ button. Browse the choices until you see ‘HDMI.’ How to connect using NVR (Network Video Recorder) This is arguably the simplest way to link your wireless CCTV camera to your TV wirelessly. We advise seeking the help of a
 professional CCTV installer
 to perform the job properly, as it’s a rather tech-heavy task.
This method depends on whether you use the HDMI cable to watch your CCTV security cameras on your television. Wirelessly means you have wire-free CCTV cameras installed, but in terms of  installing the security camera  to your television, you’ll use an HDMI cable.
Step 1:
 Link the security cameras to the Network Video recorder (NVR) gadget. Any wireless security system uses a Wi-Fi signal, and any security system has Ethernet Cat 5/6 wires.
Step 2:
 Your CCTV comes with an HDMI cable – connect it straight to the NVR (near the HDMI output port in the NVR) and link it to the HDMI input port on the television.
Step 3:
 Hook the entire security system up to the power and then switch on the cameras and NVR, separately, via its power adaptor.
Step 4:
 Finally, switch on your TV – you’ll now be able to watch your CCTV cameras while you’re switching TV stations. How to connect using NetcamViewer monitor If the technique above sounds too complicated, you may be better off following this second technique for connecting your CCTV camera to your TV wirelessly. This process uses a device known as a NetcamViewer Monitor and works if you have multiple security cameras and want to watch all of them on your TV.
A NetcamViewer Monitor is a minuscule appliance that’s easy to configure, enables you to watch your CCTV camera on your TV screen, and supports over 600 camera brands.
Step 1:
 Plug the IP camera into the NetcamViewer via the Ethernet cable.
Step 2:
 Using the HDMI cable, link the NetcamViewer to the TV.
Step 3:
 This clever device displays numerous cameras in an arrangement on a full-scale screen, displaying up to nine cameras at the same time on the screen.

Get help from installers recommended by neighbours  How to connect using streaming apps Alternatively, you can connect your camera to your TV wirelessly by using your IP camera’s viewing apps. But this is only possible if you own a smart TV from brands such as Samsung or LG.
Step 1:
 To use and connect it, download the relevant viewing app (preferably one your camera manufacturer advises).
Step 2:
 You’ll now be able to view your cameras from your smartphone via the viewing app. Advantages of using wireless CCTV There are loads of benefits of connecting wireless CCTV cameras over their wired counterparts, which we’ve listed below.
No wires – as the name suggest
The main benefit of wireless CCTV cameras is the fact they’re cable-free.
With wired CCTV systems, on the other hand, intruders can simply cut the wire using scissors. Burglars can blind the latest wired CCTV cameras by disrupting telephone lines and power cables while wireless cameras have absolutely no wires for intruders to attack.
Investing in a burglar alarm is a smart solution that goes a long way in safeguarding your home from unwelcome trespassers – check out our  burglar alarm cost guide  to find out more about prices.
Easy to install
Installing wireless CCTV is extremely simple, involves hardly any time, and enables you to position the cameras in any direction you like.
Wired CCTV cameras, though, require you to drill holes in the wall and get a mounting kit. While it’s not an overly taxing task, rigging up something to hold the camera can be laborious. Flexible With wireless CCTV, you have more flexibility, as the absence of wires lets you position them in any location you like. What’s more, you won’t have to lose sleep about hooking them up to an outlet. Not only this, you can set wireless cameras up to a whole host of locations and tangibly move them to different settings – with no wires in sight. Disadvantages to be aware of for using wireless CCTV Interference
The main drawback with wireless CCTV cameras is that they’re prone to interference, making them less trustworthy in certain situations. Because we live in an incredibly connected world, full of wireless signals and broadcasts, these competing transmissions can pose issues. Your router’s signal strength and other routers on the same bandwidth overlap and cause interference for devices.
Easy to steal
Perhaps the real sticking point of a wireless CCTV system is (depending on the camera type and how it’s fitted) how easy it could be for intruders to steal it.
Power can run out
Because wireless cameras don’t connect to a continuous external power source, they’re susceptible to running out of power and need changing. Numerous battery-operated CCTV cameras aren’t designed for constant recording, so the batteries will run out. FAQS How can I watch CCTV on my smart TV? One of the best methods to watch CCTV on your smart TV is to stream it (see ‘How to connect using streaming apps’ method above). If you’ve linked your wire-free camera via the internet, several models feature in-built systems that integrate RTSP (real-time streaming protocol), enabling connection to the camera’s app.
Simply:
Open the app on your television
Use Google’s Chromecast How can I view my security cameras on my TV? You can view your security cameras on your TV by following these straightforward steps:
Set up your security cameras to the NVR using Ethernet Cat 5/6 cables.
Connect the CCTV camera NVR to your smart TV by using your HDMI cable.
Switch on your NVR using the power adapter.
Switch your television on, and you’ll see the live view on the screen. How do wireless security cameras work? Wireless CCTV cameras work by transferring surveillance footage to a cloud-based server across the internet. Doing so allows you to watch the footage on your television or any other internet-connected gadget, but you’ll still need wired power.

How to cut plastic lattice fencing,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/cut-plastic-lattice-fencing/,Garden,"How to cut plastic lattice fencing

In This Blog: How to cut plastic lattice fencing How to cut lattice without a saw FAQs If you’re researching how to cut plastic lattice fencing, you’re either installing or repairing a fence and need some guidance on how to do this easily and safely.
Thankfully, this guide is going to take you through the process step by step. So, read on for our top tips and expert guidance.
Don’t forget to check out our  how to build a fence  guide for more handy DIY advice. How to cut plastic lattice fencing Tools you’ll need for the job
To make short work of your plastic lattice fencing, you’ll need the following:
Safety equipment
Pencil
Ruler
Fence clamps
Circular saw
Step 1: Measure the area
If you’re installing a new lattice fence, it’s worth cutting it to size beforehand. To do this, measure the area of your project and write down the W, H and L measurements. You can then either buy the same size lattice panels or you can cut your existing plastic lattice panels to size.
Top tip:
 Leave around 0.25 inches on either side of the lattice to allow for adverse weather conditions that can contract and expand the plastic.
Step 2: Make allowances for frames
If you’re using frames, make sure the lattice measurements take into account the framing materials, caps, and dividers. Use the following calculation as an example:
Project space:
 6ft wide (72 inches) + 
Buffer
: 0.25 inches = 
72.25 inches
Subtract the frame thickness:
 6 inches.
Width of lattice to be cut: 
 72.25 – 6 = 
66.25 inches
.
Step 3: Make allowances for the height of the lattice fence
For plastic lattice fences that are being used as garden borders, add around 2 inches to the height. This allows them to be secured in the soil, keeping them firmly in place.
Step 4: Mark where you need to cut the lattice
Now your measurements are set, it’s time to put on your protective equipment and get to work. Take your pencil and ruler and draw a straight line where the lattice needs to be cut.
Top tip:
 Remove the staples and nails that the pencil touches. This reduces the risk of spring back and makes cutting the lattice easier.
Step 5: Line up the lattice
Once your lattice is prepared, place it on a sturdy, flat surface. Line up the lattice so the pencil line is about 3 inches away from the edge of your flat surface and secure with the clamps. This will stop your lattice from moving while you make the cuts.
Step 6: Cut the lattice to size
Take your circular saw and set the blade half an inch wider than your lattice’s thickness. A vinyl cutting blade will be best for this job. However, a reciprocating saw will also work. (Just don’t use anything designed for wood).
Once you’re ready to make the cuts, squeeze the saw’s trigger and slowly follow the pencil line.
Hurrah! You’ve now cut your plastic lattice fencing.
Note:
 If you don’t know how to competently use a circular saw, we highly recommend  hiring a professional .

Find fencers your neighbours recommend  How to cut lattice without a saw If you don’t have a cutting saw, then we recommend using a handheld wire cutting tool. It will take you longer; however, it’s a more precise finish and far less dangerous! FAQs What is the best tool to use to cut plastic lattice?
A circular saw with vinyl-cutting blades is your best bet. Otherwise, a good pair of fence cutters will do the job.
How do you cut plastic lattice?
You either  hire one of our experts  for a professional finish or you attempt to do it yourself following our step-by-step guide above.
Should I hire a professional?
We always recommend hiring a professional for jobs that involve tools like saws. However, it’s also worth investing in a fencing expert to make sure the finished result is long-lasting and durable.

How to fix a sagging sofa,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/fix-sagging-sofa/,Living Room,"How to fix a sagging sofa

In This Blog: How to fix a sagging sofa How to fix sagging sofa cushions yourself How to fix sagging sofa springs How to fix a sagging sofa with plywood FAQs There are several reasons you might need to learn how to fix a sagging sofa. Sadly, our beloved couches don’t last forever. However, if you’re not quite ready to give up your trusty stead, you might be tempted to fix it instead.
You can do this by hiring an expert to complete a professional repair or by attempting various DIY methods yourself.
This blog is going to focus on the latter. So, read on for our step by step guide.

Find repairers your neighbours recommend  How to fix a sagging sofa Before you begin, you need to work out the cause of the sagging. Is it a broken frame? Are the springs old and worn? Or do the cushions need restoring?
Once you’ve identified the cause, it’s time to get to work. How to fix sagging sofa cushions yourself If your sofa is sagging because of worn-out cushions, then it’s a good time to wash the cushion covers and revamp the inside layer with new stuffing. Most cushions are filled with foam and ‘batting,’ which is an upholstery fabric made out of wool, cotton or polyester blends. The batting covers the foam to create a smooth finish. So, if the batting is worn, you can just replace it and leave the foam. But if the foam is dented, it’s worth replacing the entire cushion.
To do this, either  hire a professional  to restore your cushions for an expert finish or take the entire cushion to your local upholstery shop so they can replace it for you. Alternatively, measure the height, width and depth of your foam and batting and order replacement materials online.
Top tip:
 If you’re doing it yourself, be sure to cut the batting to shape. We recommend layering it around the foam and smoothing it out to avoid lumps.

Find repairers your neighbours recommend  How to fix sagging sofa springs Repairing sagging sofa springs is one of the trickier aspects of sofa repairs. So, unless you’re a confident DIY’er, we highly recommend hiring a professional to come and do the job for you. Read our  sofa spring repair cost guide  for information about pricing up your project.
However, if you’d like to do it yourself, read our step by step guide below.
Step one:
 Inspect the springs on your sofa by removing the dust cover. Does your couch use zigzag or coiled springs? And are they bent or broken?
We ask because bent springs are easier to fix yourself while broken springs require a professional replacement due to the need for specialised tools.
Step two:
 For springs that are bent, use a pair of pliers to bend them back into shape. This works for zigzag springs but will have a limited effect on coiled makes, which will need to be replaced.
Step three:
 If you still want to do it yourself, remove any broken springs and recycle them. Then, use a spring compressor tool on either end of the replacement spring, turning the handles clockwise with a wrench to pry the coils open. This will allow you to thread each end of the spring through the supports screwed into opposite ends of your sofa.
Step four:
 Turn the compression tool anticlockwise to decompress the springs and secure them in place.
Step five:
 Replace any fabric or dust cover that needed removing to get to the springs.
Note:
 This is a dangerous job that needs to be done using proper care and consideration. Trapped fingers and spring-back accidents are common occurrences. How to fix a sagging sofa with plywood For broken frames, you can use plywood to fix the issue. There are two issues plywood can resolve when it comes to a sagging sofa. These are broken slats or broken frames. We’re going to explain how to fix both.
Tools you need for the job
Before you get started, add the following to your arsenal:
Replacement wood
Screwdriver
Nail remover
Wood filler
Staple gun
Step one:
 Check the slats and frame and remove any broken wood. Do this carefully to avoid tearing your sofa fabric. Pry out any nails or broken springs attached to the wood.
Step two:
 Work out what replacement wood is needed and purchase the right dimensions, plus a little extra in case you make a mistake.
Step three:
 Remove the broken boards with the new boards using your staple gun to secure them in place. For extra security, add wood glue to the joints and let everything dry overnight.
Step four:
 Once your wood glue is set, reupholster your sofa by replacing any fabric or springs.

Find repairers your neighbours recommend  FAQs How can I make my sofa firmer?
To make your sofa firmer, replace your cushion filling with higher-density foam and batting. You can also secure a piece of plywood between the couch frame and the cushions, which adds extra support. 
Note:
 This won’t work for couches with cushions that are permanently attached.
Can you fix a sunken couch?
It’s possible to follow our step by step guide above to fix a sunken couch. However, for a long-lasting and professional finish, we always recommend  hiring one of our experts .
How do you fix a sagging couch with plywood?
Follow our ‘how to fix a sagging sofa with plywood’ guide above. Alternatively,  hire an expert your neighbours recommend  to undertake a professional repair.
How to fix a sagging leather sofa
Follow our above steps or  hire an expert your neighbours recommend  to undertake a professional repair. If you opt to go down the DIY route and replace your cushion filling, make sure you replace it with high-density foam and batting.

The installation cost isn’t very high, and it will help you keep damp and moisture out.
As a homeowner, you’d be constantly fighting against damp. If it’s allowed to settle anywhere, it will end up causing problems. Damp can get into wood, plaster, fabric and slowly degrades them or causes rot and mould. You and your family may even start facing health issues.
Fortunately, once you’ve determined that it’s your sub floor void that’s causing the problem, sub floor ventilation installation costs are quite affordable. And, it doesn’t take much time to install. Sub floor ventilation installation cost Cost provided item

£770 – £1,000
, while fitting 7 air bricks costs can range anywhere from 
£450 – £1,200
.
Unfortunately, you can’t foresee these kinds of expenses, but you can’t postpone getting the mould and rising damp fixed until you have sufficient funds. It’s vital to stop this as soon as possible to prevent floor moisture from causing a lot of harm fast.
To find a solution to best suit you, it’s best to speak with ventilation experts – you can find ventilation professionals that your neighbours recommend easily by searching your postcode here on Checkatrade.

See who your neighbours recommend for the job  What is a sub floor void? A sub floor void is the region underneath a ground floor, suspended timber floor. The size of this region varies considerably from zero, in which floor joists touch the substrate underneath, to an object you can crawl beneath. Usually, its actual size is roughly 300-400mm in depth (from the floorboards’ undersides to the substrate underneath). Find out more about  the cost of floor insulation  by heading to our expert guide. Passive air vents cost If you need an air vent but without moving parts or any noise, passive air brick’s a great option. What’s more, it doesn’t cost anything at all to run it and they’re incredibly straightforward to install, not to mention small and fast. The cost of passive air vents starts from around 
£20
 and is designed to reduce, if not eliminate, condensation and mould. What are sub floor ventilation airbricks? Sub floor ventilation airbricks are a special kind of brick featuring holes to enable the circulation of fresh outdoor air underneath suspended floors and inside cavity walls to stop moisture from accumulating due to damp or cold air resting in empty spaces or voids. Positive pressure ventilation system cost You can expect to pay around 
£400 
to have a positive pressure ventilation system installed by a trusted floor installer, however, costs can go right up to
 £500
, while on the lower pricing scale, you can pay 
£300
.

See who your neighbours recommend for the job  Sub floor ventilation installation quotes Finding a tradesperson shouldn’t be difficult. We’re here to help – we always advise getting at least three quotes from our trusted tradespeople.
Our  request a quote  feature is great for getting quotes from the tradespeople all your neighbours are talking about. Simply post details about the job you want doing and we’ll send it out to local tradespeople in your area. FAQs How do you calculate sub floor ventilation? You can calculate sub floor ventilation using the below formula:
Multiply subfloor length x width x height
This will give you your sub floor ventilation area in metres squared. Does a suspended floor need ventilation? Yes, because ventilation prevents the build-up of moisture within the floor structure.

How to remove a broken key from your lock,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/remove-broken-key-from-lock/,"Conservatory, Garage","How to remove a broken key from your lock

In This Blog: Removing a broken key from a lock – security & safety first How to remove a broken key from a lock Removing the broken key from the lock What not to do when removing a broken key from a lock When to call a locksmith to remove a broken key from a lock? FAQ’s Having to remove a broken key from a lock is up there as one of the tasks we all hope we won’t ever have to do.
In this guide, we look at what to do and what not to do to remove a broken key from a lock. Removing a broken key from a lock – security & safety first Safety must always come first. If your key has broken in the lock, did this happen with the door locked or unlocked? If the door is locked and the key has snapped off with no part sticking out of the lock, then the lock is ever so slightly more secure, but understandably most people will not feel happy leaving it this way for any length of time.
If the key snapped off before locking the door then you should resolve the situation immediately.
In a situation where children or medication are inside a locked property and the key has broken, or you are in an emergency then it is advisable to call an emergency locksmith in your area to avoid any delay.

Find locksmiths your neighbours recommend  How to remove a broken key from a lock Tools you’ll need to remove a broken key from a lock
In an ideal situation, you would have a broken key extractor to hand. If you’re here reading this though, chances are you don’t. Not to self, buy or order one from your local hardware shop! The following tools and items will come in handy:
Spray Lubricant – ideally an oil-free, silicone-based spray
Pliers
Needle-nose tweezers or pliers
Jigsaw or hacksaw blade
If you don’t have an oil-free or silicone-based lubricant you can use WD-40 but it is not ideal and could result in clogging up the locking mechanism.
Other useful items:
Flathead screwdriver
Steel wire or paper clips
Bobbybin or hair grip Removing the broken key from the lock If you have a broken key extractor kit then now is the time to use it. There is usually an assortment of long thin tools in this kit to use to slide down the side of the key to help to pull it out.
If you don’t have a kit and you’re attempting to remove the key with the tools mentioned above then try the following:
 If you can still see part of the key
 – spray some lubricant into the lock and using the pliers, pull on the exposed end of the key to try and pull it out.
Using super glue to stick something to the end of the key is the last resort so don’t attempt this unless you’ve tried other methods first.
If you can’t see part of the key
 – again, spray lubricant into the lock. Slide the hacksaw or jigsaw blade into the lock with the serrated edges pointing down and try to drag the key out of the lock. Depending on the size and shape of your hacksaw blade it can help to snap off the end part of the blade so you have a thin edge to insert into the lock.
If you don’t have a blade then you can attempt this with the needle-nose pliers or tweezers.
It may also be possible to try and use a flathead screwdriver to remove the broken key from the lock. If you have a flathead screwdriver that is small enough to fit into the keyhole, try inserting it in the lock.
You may be able to wiggle the screwdriver and pull it back towards you to loosen the key until you can see part of it emerging from the lock. Then you can use pliers to grab hold of the end of the key to remove the broken key from the lock.
If you have no luck with either of these methods after a couple of quick attempts then it is time to call a locksmith.

Find locksmiths your neighbours recommend  What not to do when removing a broken key from a lock Push the key in further
Use the wrong type or too much oil
This first point sounds very obvious, but in the moment when you might be panicking it’s easy to be too hasty and maybe even a bit clumsy. Take a moment to be calm, get your tools organised, and think through what you are going to do before rushing into it.
As mentioned above, WD40 is not recommended for removing a broken key in a lock, as too much oil can be counterproductive and actually clog up the locking mechanism. When to call a locksmith to remove a broken key from a lock? The situation is time-critical or happens at night time
Your lock cylinder is complex – trying to remove yourself may damage the lock
If you don’t have the tools to try yourself or are worried about damaging your door or the lock.
Hopefully, this is common sense, but if you find yourself in an emergency situation or your key breaks in the lock in the middle of the night, then calling a professional locksmith is the sensible thing to do.
Some door lock cylinders can be complex and trying to save money by removing a broken key from a door lock by yourself may end up costing you more.
Get an idea of how much a locksmith could cost by reading our  locksmith cost guide . FAQ’s Why do keys break?
Keys can break for a few different reasons, the main one is wear and tear. After a lot of repeated use, the teeth on the key can get worn down and catch in the lock, causing it to snap.
How to maintain a door lock?
A poorly maintained lock can also cause a key to snap, so it is a good idea to spray a silicone-based lubricant into the lock every 6 months. If you find that you have to use extra pressure to insert the key into the lock then consider getting a new set of keys cut.
Other things that can affect your door lock that you should check a couple of times a year are
Is your door hung correctly?
Are the door’s screws and strike plates aligned?
Test the latch and deadbolt.

How to choose an electric shower,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/how-to-choose-an-electric-shower/,Tag Not Found,"How to choose an electric shower

Cold, intermittent showers are a common problem for many homeowners and it often forces them to consider a new electric unit for their bathroom. Installing an electric shower means they never again have to stand around waiting for water to heat up, or worry about the hot water cutting out in the middle of a wash.
There is a huge variety of electric showers out there and this can make it difficult to decide what’s best for each home. As such, we’ve put together this handy electric shower guide to help you choose the right model.
How do electric showers work?
Electric showers include a heating element in the unit and rely on an electrical connection with a cold-water supply. Electricity fires up the heating element in the unit which warms water as it passes through towards the head unit. The end result is an almost-instant hot shower on demand.
Why should I recommend an electric shower?
The most obvious benefit is you don’t have to rely on the hot water tank supply. That said, there a several other advantages to purchasing an electric shower:
It minimises water and power usage, saving a lot of money on utility bills in the long run
You get a constant desired water temperature
Easy to install and fits into most plumbing systems
Offers great versatility with various controls available
How do I choose a good electric shower? 
There is a vast amount of choice when it comes to electric showers – each with a range of controls, styles, functions and pressure ratings available. We’ll run through all the different factors and features to consider so you can choose the best model for clients’ homes.
Choosing thermostatic controls 
Electric showers come with thermostatic controls for tweaking the temperature, and there are multiple types available:
Digital interface – display screen that can include a digital thermostat and various buttons for temperature control. These can also be touch screen.
Remote – Digital remotes can be used instead of the usual control attachments for a shower.
Dials – More traditional models come with dials for adjusting the temperature.
The type of controls you choose is up to the customer’s needs, so make sure you keep their preference in mind. They might prefer having more control functions on a touchscreen, or instead may want a less complicated interface with simple dials. Whichever you choose, look out for the higher quality showers which will do a better job of keeping the temperature steady when the controls are adjusted.
Environmentally friendly options
Some electric showers come with an eco setting to reduce water waste and power consumption. Homeowners can also save more money on their utility bills with these models. If this is important to a customer, try to avoid showers with a high wattage rating as these typically use more energy and water.
Temperature safety functions 
When choosing a shower, make sure it comes with built-in functions for temperature safety. The two features to look out for are:
A safety stop function — electric showers should have a safety function which stops the flow immediately if the water gets too hot
A high-temperature cap to prevent accidental scalding
Limescale protection features
Limescale build-up will damage the shower head and pipes, which can also affect a property’s water pressure in the long term. For this reason, you should choose a shower that is designed to prevent this from occurring. These models will usually have lengthened heating elements and wider coil gaps in the shower unit, so make sure you pay close attention to the specifications.
Water pressure
Each household has its own water pressure system that must be factored in when choosing an electric shower. You should ensure the shower is suitable for the level of water pressure in the pipes, otherwise the appliance wont function properly. For example, low-pressure systems may need an electric shower with an integrated pump to achieve a sufficient pressure level.
Shower heads
This will be based on customer preference, but keep in mind there is a range of shower heads to choose from with different functionalities. Some will have multiple spray patterns to switch between, while others come with eco performance options to help save energy and water.
Installation 
For the most part, electric showers are pretty easy to install, but you should still pay attention to some design features that can potentially cause problems. Look out for the number of water and cable entry points on the appliance, because just one or two entry points can make the shower more difficult to install. It could lead to rewiring problems or make it too impractical to install a shower in the desired position.
Also, check the wall fixings. Some showers will only have a wall fixing aperture at one end, meaning they’re only suitable for replacements instead of installations.
Steam
Electric showers produce large amounts of steam due to the way they heat water. This can create damp in the home so it’s best to purchase a model that minimises the amount produced, especially for clients with older properties that aren’t as insulated.
Best electric showers in 2021
There are hundreds of different electric shower models. To narrow it down and make your life easier, here’s a list of the best electric showers on the market today:
REDRING Pure
Mira Sport Max
Mira Azora
Bristan BL3105 B
Bristan Glee 3
Gainsborough Electric Shower
Aqualisa Quartz
Triton MOSV07SG Seville
Triton Martinique
Triton Kito
As well as shortlisting, always make sure to look at reviews to help you make your decision.
What wattage electric shower do I need?
Electric showers generally range between 5kW and 10.5kW ratings. They need this electrical power to generate water pressure and heat the water, resulting in a consistent temperature with strong water flow. Higher voltage means higher pressure, but keep in mind these models will be pricier. What’s more, not every home should install the most powerful electric shower. It’s best to purchase a shower with a wattage range that suits the size of the home’s water tank and the reliability of its water supply.
Here’s a guideline:
If the water supply is somewhat unreliable or the property has a small water tank, aim to buy in the 5kW-8kW range.
If there’s a large water tank and steady water flow in the home, you can choose from the 8kW-10.5kW range.
FAQs
Do electric showers need hot water? 
Electric showers heat the cold-water supply using electricity, so you don’t need hot water for it to operate.
Is a power shower the same as an electric shower? 
Power showers and electric showers operate differently when it comes to water supply. Only cold water is fed into an electric shower, whereas a power shower uses both hot and cold water from the home’s storage tank.
What size cable and pipe are required for an electric shower? 
The size of cable for an electric shower will depend on the wattage. That being said, it’s probably best to install a 10 mm² cable to avoid needing a larger one if the electric shower is replaced in the future.
Water pipes for electric showers are usually 15mm in diameter.
Do electric showers have pumps?
Although some models can be bought with a small internal pump, most electric showers don’t have one built in. That’s why you need to make sure the water mains pressure is performing properly.
Do I need an electric shower?
If members of the household take long showers in succession, they may find the water tank is running out of hot water too quickly. In this case, electric showers will be the way to go to ensure a steady supply. They also tend to be more environmentally friendly in terms of both energy and water consumption.
What is a good flow rate for an electric shower?
A flow rate of four litres per minute is considered the minimum for an adequate shower. Five litres per minute would be considered a good flow rate.
How much does it cost to run an electric shower?
This varies depending on the water provider, water flow and temperature. But as a guideline, you can expect the cost to be around 40p per 10 minutes running time. Power-wise, electric showers are slightly more expensive than traditional systems, but you have the benefits of faster heating, better water pressure and constant hot water.

Trade demand booms while supply chains suffer,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/news/tradespeople-supply-issues/,Tag Not Found,"Trade demand booms while supply chains suffer

There’s a high demand for tradespeople at the moment, which is a double-edged sword for our members. Although it’s great for them to be in high demand, they’re having to book jobs well into the future. This means that homeowners are waiting longer for their work to start or they’re taking the risk by using tradespeople with availability, rather than checking whether they’re qualified for the job.
How has this happened?
There are a few reasons. Some of the issues are a knock-on effect as a result of Covid-19 and Brexit. Also, there was, and continues to be, a large number of home renovation projects happening across the UK, primarily due to lockdowns and homeowners deciding to invest in their properties. Then there are the bottlenecks that occur with the lack of material supplies, which delays projects even further.
That said, even though it might be longer before our members can start your work, it’s well worth the wait. You can be comfortable in the knowledge our members are checked by us, reviewed by your neighbours, and then checked by us again. Even better, we  guarantee  their work!
Why are there material shortages?
There are many reasons for the current  material shortages . They’re mostly related to high demand, the pandemic, and Brexit.
Checkatrade CEO Mike Fairman said, “
The current global raw materials shortage has had a profound impact on the UK trade and construction industry. Soaring demand, the impact of Brexit, continued pandemic recovery and shock factors like forest fire threats in North America are all reasons behind the shortages we have seen.”
You can read more about the  material shortages and price rises here .
Why wait for the right tradesperson?
Despite the waiting times, it’s better to 
hold out for a reputable trade
 instead of hiring anyone who’s available. Although we understand the frustrations of waiting to get your dream home renovations started, you should always hire a tradesperson for their quality, not for their availability.
How can you check their quality?
Tradespeople have to pass stringent checks before we even consider them as one of our members. So, save yourself some time searching for the best tradespeople by searching for our members.
Even after a tradesperson passes our checks, we continue to check them to make sure they’re still great at what they do. Just one of those checks is of
 the reviews left by your neighbours
 to make sure they’re not fake.
Our 
NEW guarantee  is another benefit of using our service. We’re so confident in the quality of our member’s work that we’ll guarantee it for 12-months completely free, meaning you’re covered in the rare event that your job doesn’t go to plan. Find out more  here .
How to get your job completed
Here are some of the things you can do to speed up the process of booking in your job.
Make sure you approach the right tradespeople
It might sound obvious, but making sure you’re approaching the right person for the job is about doing your research. For example,  carpenters  and  electricians  cover a wide range of jobs within their roles.
It’s also a good idea to take a look at the trade’s previous work. That way you can see if the job you’re planning is something they specialise in. You can easily do this by taking a look at their profile on our site.
Give yourself options by requesting at least 3 quotes
The more quotes you request, the more likely you are to hear back from one of our members. Aim to look for local tradespeople as they will likely have local knowledge of local planning permission and supplier networks should your project need this information. They’ll also be close, which means they’re nearby in case any issues arise during your project.
Save time and effort, use our  request a quote  feature – be as detailed as possible in the form
When you’re looking for a reliable tradesperson or team, you can save a lot of time by putting as much information as possible into your initial enquiry. A great way to do this and get multiple quotes is to use our  request a quote  feature to post your job. Once you post the details, we do the searching for you.
Giving as much detail as possible in your request a quote form means our members get a good idea of what is needed for your project. They can then give accurate costs, a realistic start date, and a rough time to complete your project. It’s likely when they reply to your request a quote they will come back to you with additional questions and advice, a quote, or to book a time to come and visit you to discuss it more.
Request a quote is also great for matching you up with the right person/people for your project. Even better, 
once you post your job
, your job information is 
sent to three recommended members in your local area.
Conclusion
It’s worth waiting for one of our guaranteed Checkatrade members to take on your job
Make sure you thoroughly fill out the  request a quote  form to help improve your chances of contacting the right tradesperson/people for the job
Request a minimum of three quotes to increase your chances of a callback (easily done with  request a quote !)

Guide to bathroom water pressure,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/guide-to-bathroom-water-pressure/,Tag Not Found,"Guide to bathroom water pressure

If someone’s been living in a home for a while, it can be difficult to know if the bathroom water pressure has changed or if it’s at the level it should be. Homeowners often don’t realise their water pressure is too low or high, as it can feel normal if the change happens gradually over time.
That’s why it’s important to understand and check water pressure so you can ensure clients’ showers, baths and taps are working properly. This guide will take you through reasons the water pressure could be wrong, how to test bathroom water pressure and what’s needed to fix any issues you find.
What is water pressure and how is it affected?
Water pressure is how quickly water flows through the pipes for bathroom appliances, so it has a massive impact on the quality of showering and how fast a bath fills up. The force of the water is measured in bars, with one bar being enough to push water up to the height of 10 metres.
Water pressure systems are different for each property. It can even vary depending on the room and the time of day. During the morning, for instance, some might experience low water pressure in the bathroom because other houses in the area will be using their showers and baths at the same time.
Types of water pressure systems
There are three different types of systems that will influence water pressure supply and the standard measurement of water pressure in the bathroom. Understanding the system in a particular home will give you a better idea of what level the pressure should be running at.
Gravity fed heating system
This type of system is typically found in older homes, featuring a cold-water storage tank and a hot water cylinder. Gravity fed systems usually operate at quite a low water pressure, so expect bathroom taps and showers to be running at around a 0.2 bar rating.
Combi boiler system 
Combi boilers are fed with water from the mains pressure supply, which it then pumps around your home at about the same level of pressure as the mains. If a combi boiler system is in place, water pressure will be high. Taps and showers should normally be around 1-1.5 bar.
Unvented system 
Unvented water systems are made up of just a main cylinder, which is filled directly from the water mains and maintains a high pressure level. With this setup, bathroom appliances will be running at about 2 bars.
How do I find out my water pressure?
Now that you’ve got an understanding of what water pressure to expect in the bathroom, the next step is to find out the water pressure reading so you can compare.
Your first option is to get in contact with the water supplier as they’ll have the skills and equipment to deliver a precise reading for you. Alternatively, you can test the pressure yourself with a pressure gauge, which can be purchased online or at a plumbing outlet.
Here’s a step-by-step process to measuring bathroom tap pressure with a pressure gauge:
Ensure no water is running
Attach your gauge to the tap
Turn the tap on fully
Jot down the reading and compare it to your expected pressure rating
How can I test the water pressure for my shower?
There’s also a way you can work out if the shower pressure is working properly. This is without the use of a pressure gauge, however, so you’ll be calculating the water flow rate instead. While you won’t be able to get an actual pressure reading, this method still provides a good indicator of how the shower is performing. You’ll need a measuring jug, a calculator and a stopwatch to carry out this test.
Place your jug under the shower head
Turn on the shower and fill the jug for exactly six seconds using the stopwatch
Measure the amount of water in litres and multiply this by 10 which will give you the water flow rate per minute
Your measurement should fall into one of the following rankings. This will indicate the level of the water pressure in the shower:
Low flow rate = Less than 10 litres
Normal flow rate = 10-15 litres
High flow rate = More than 15 litres
Why is the water pressure low? 
After testing the bathroom appliances, you may find the water pressure is lower than it should be for that particular system. If this is the case, there are several factors you need to consider to help you diagnose the problem. These are the main causes:
Build-up of hard water deposits. These deposits can block the valve, aerator, pipes or showerhead.
Blocked pipes can affect bathroom water pressure. Blockages happen as rust and minerals clog the hot water output.
A leak may have occurred. This a serious incident that can damage the structure of the property.
If none of the above apply, there could be a problem with the water mains supply. This should be reported to the local water provider so they can fix the issue.
How do I increase water pressure in my bathroom?
There are a few ways you can increase bathroom water pressure should you discover it’s too low:
Clean or replace pipes –
 Clean and remove hard water scale and sediment build-up inside the plumbing lines. Or, replace the old pipework.
Correct taps and shower head – 
Make sure the taps and showers are suited to the water pressure system. For example, a tap that requires a high bar rating to function won’t perform properly with a low-pressure system.
Install a power shower –
 The appliance uses a built-in electric pump to provide a stronger jet of water.
Fit a shower pump –
 Shower pumps increase water pressure in the pipes before it comes out the shower head.
For more useful information on improving water pressure, check out our article  here .
What if my bathroom water pressure is too high?
High water pressure should be fixed quickly as it can pose many problems for a home, including:
Wasted water and more costly water bills
Plumbing leaks and subsequent damage
Shortened lifespan for a water heater
Boiler and piping damage
The root of the problem will usually be the water regulator which is found where the mains enters the home. You’ll have to tinker with the water pressure for the entire property rather than just the bathroom.
Adjusting a water regulator 
Best-case scenario, you’ll have to adjust the water regulator. Here’s how:
Locate the water mains valve and turn it off
Loosen the locking nut on the regulator using a wrench
Use a screwdriver to turn the screw on the regulator anti-clockwise in small increments. This will decrease the water pressure
Test the water pressure to see if it’s now in the correct bar range. If not, adjust the regulator again accordingly
Once you’ve achieved the right pressure level, secure the lock nut on your regulator
Turn the water mains valve back on
Replacing a water regulator
You’ll need to replace the valve if the regulator is no longer reducing water pressure. Here’s the step-by-step process:
Turn off the water at the mains and run a faucet to empty the pipes.
Grab hold of the pipe below the deice and turn it using a wrench.
The pipe and regulator should gradually separate, at which point you can remove the old regulator.
Place the new regulator into the pipe. Bear in mind you might need a pipe fitting if the regulator end is too large.
Next, tighten the pipe connected to the regulator to keep it in place.
Program or switch on the regulator and make sure it’s running at the desired level of water pressure.
Finally, turn the water mains back on and check there aren’t any leaks around the pipes.
Installing a water regulator
You may find that the property doesn’t even have a water regulator. It would be a good idea to install one to ensure water pressure is kept at a normal level. Regulators can be purchased for around £35.
FAQs
Is 2.5 bar water pressure good?
Whether this reading is good will depend on what water pressure system is installed in the home. You’ll need to compare what bar range is suitable for the property.
What does 3 bar water pressure mean?
As mentioned, water pressure is the force of the water moving through pipes and is measured in bars. This is enough force to raise water to a height of 30 metres. This is considered high.
What is the best water pressure for a tap or a shower?
The best water pressure for a tap or shower will depend on what water system the property has in place. Note, low water pressure only in showers might indicate a problem with the unit, while low pressure in bathroom taps is more likely to be down to a problem with the home’s plumbing network.

How to start a window cleaning business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/start-window-cleaning-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a window cleaning business

No matter how nice windows are at first, they all will get dirty over time, obscuring beautiful views and light flow. Returning those windows to their sparkling clean state is the job of a window cleaner and that’s where you come in. Wondering how to start a window cleaning business? Read on.
With the help of this guide, you’ll discover the best ways to get started in the busy world of window cleaning. We’ve also included tips to build a business plan, guidance on making your company profitable, and advice on the different start-up costs involved.
How to start a UK window cleaning business
Window cleaning is an essential but physically demanding job that is full of potential. The good news? This career path is open to anyone willing to work hard even those without years of experience.
However, you’ll need some training and practice before you strike out on your own and working as a window cleaner is the perfect way to get one foot on this career ladder.
Let’s look at how to start a UK window cleaning business. The following list covers some of the first steps to building your own company:
Ensure you have health and safety training if you’ll be using a ladder. Thankfully it’s no longer necessary to balance precariously on a ladder while cleaning windows but you’ll need to invest in a range of equipment to allow you to do your job from the ground.
Choose a unique company name and register this with Companies House. The name can be meaningful, unforgettable, and fun to help customers remember you.
Ensure you’re physically fit enough to properly do this job. If you plan to use a ladder, check out our  working at height guide  to help keep you safe.
Look at your competitors, what they charge, and how they market themselves in order to see where your company can fit into the industry. Look for gaps in the market where you can fulfil extra demand.
Research the industry and any new advances in technology like water-fed poles to ensure you’re offering your customers the best service.
Coming up with a window cleaning business plan
To help your company progress and reach its potential, you’ll need to come up with a window cleaning business plan. This will help you to attract investors and will be a document you refer back to time and time again while building your company.
Make sure to include the following points:
The market
Knowing the market and your customers well is the key to succeeding in any business. You need to ensure that your customers needs are being met by the services you offer to build good relationships.
It’s also key to know all about your competitors. You can look at their pricing, the services they offer, and work out how you’ll ensure customers pick you over them.
In order to attract customers, you’ll need to get your company name out there. You can do this through local social media groups, paid advertising, word of mouth, or handing out flyers. An alternate option available to anyone starting a window cleaning business is to  join Checkatrade  and benefit from the huge number of customer leads we receive regularly.
Finance
Managing a business well means paying attention to your finances.
Firstly, you’ll need to cover any start up costs; will you self-fund or take out a loan or credit card?
You also need to decide how you’ll price your services, look at how much your competitors charge for guidance, and ensure you’ll make a profit. If you have a head for numbers, you can even predict your earnings over time.
Keep track of any financial records including money coming in and going out of your account. This will help when it comes to paying taxes and National Insurance.
Confused? Don’t worry, running your company finances can be tricky and if that part of starting your business is something you need extra support with, we’d recommend hiring an accountant, undergoing training, or reading online guides for more details.
Business strategy
This is where you consider the logistics of your company. You need to look at what services you’ll offer, the hours you’ll work, the area where you’ll work, how you’ll source your tools and whether you’ll hire employees.
You’ll also need to decide how you’ll get from one job to the next. If you have a lot of equipment we’d suggest investing in a van.
Legalities and insurance
Starting a new business is a big commitment and you’ll need to make sure you operate within the law. This means registering with HMRC and paying the right amount of tax. It’s also well worth signing up for insurance to prevent any legal or financial issues affecting your company. Consider at least getting public liability insurance, business equipment insurance and van insurance.
How to grow a window cleaning business
You may need to start small when it comes to building your own business and this is very common. But once your company has found its feet you could consider expanding. This will help you to increase your profits and meet the needs of more customers.
Below, we’ve listed a few of the ways to grow your window cleaning business:
Better equipment
: Investing in new equipment is a great way of offering more and better-quality services. This means you can work more efficiently and charge more for your work.
Incentives:
 You can offer incentives to new customers when they sign up for regular window cleaning over a set period of time. This means more repeat work, allowing you to build your client base.
Hire new workers
: Unable to fulfil the demand for your services? Why not hire new employees to help expand your company?
New services
: Once you get to grips with owning a window cleaning business, you may want to consider offering other types of services to grow your company.
What do I need to start a window cleaning business?
You won’t need expensive equipment to get started in this industry, in fact, you may even already own some of the essentials. Having said this, if you plan to work from the ground rather than a ladder you’ll need extra tools like a water-fed pole to allow you to reach high windows.
So, what do you need to start a window cleaning business? At the bare minimum, your window cleaning business start-up kit should include:
Bucket
Ladder
Window cleaning detergent
Microfibre cloths
Squeegee
Scraper
Bucket belt
Remember, there are many other types of equipment that you should consider investing in if you want to grow your business and give your customers the best quality service. On a tight budget? No problem, just  join Checkatrade  to receive large discounts on all your business essentials through our Buyers Club.
FAQs
How much does it cost to start a window cleaning business?
Getting started in the window cleaning business is as easy as buying the basic equipment and driving to your customers’ homes. In fact, you could start out as a small company from as little as £100. Perfect if you don’t have any savings.
Of course, if you want to build a large business you’ll need to invest in more advanced equipment and marketing to reach more customers. You’ll also need a van to transport your equipment and insurance to protect your company in case of accidents or mistakes.
Is a window cleaning business profitable?
With low start-up costs and overheads, you can build a successful, small business no matter your financial situation. This means that a window cleaning business can be profitable right from the start. The amount you actually make will depend on the services you offer, your experience, your efficiency, the amount you charge and the demand in your area.
Thankfully, window cleaners will always be needed as most people are either too busy or physically unable to clean their own windows. Especially on upper floors.
How much can a window cleaning business make?
Again, this will depend on a range of factors, but as a rough guide, a window cleaner working alone can earn £200 a day. This means if you expand your company to include other employees you can earn more and more each day.
For more information, tips and prices, give our handy  window cleaning prices guide  a read.
How do you charge for window cleaning?
Working out how to charge for your services doesn’t need to be a stressful process. The best way to start is to look at how much your competitors charge to get a rough idea of what people are willing to pay in the area. You can then consider how your services stack up against your competitors. For example, if your services are better quality, or you offer less common services you can charge more.
When it comes to actually taking payment for your services you have a few options. You can ask for cash in hand, but make sure to keep a record of this. Otherwise, you can ask for a bank transfer or you can invest in a card machine. The right option will be personal to your company and needs.
Do you need a licence to be a window cleaner in England?
No, but you can consider getting accreditation from The Federation of Window Cleaners to show your customers you’re a legitimate business.
Useful checklist for starting a window cleaning business
Your business plan should include information on how you plan to market, run, fund, and protect your company.
Starting a window cleaning company isn’t too complicated and start-up costs will be anything from £100 upwards.
You can make a good profit by building your own window cleaning business as long as you offer a high-quality service and meet the needs of your customers. Joining Checkatrade  is a brilliant way to attract customers, save on business essentials and give your company credibility.
You don’t need to work on a high, dangerous ladder as the technology now exists to allow you to work from the ground.

How to start a window fitting business,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/trade/start-window-fitting-business/,Tag Not Found,"How to start a window fitting business

Windows play a variety of key roles in any building. From letting in sunlight, to offering stunning views and keeping the structure insulated, these panes of glass are multi-functional. What’s more, there’s no escaping the fact that we all depend on windows, making learning how to start a window fitting business a great choice.
Whether you have experience in this industry or are a newcomer, this guide is ideal to support your new business venture. You’ll learn how to put together a business plan, how to choose a company name, the different start-up costs involved and so much more.
First steps to start a window fitting business
Window fitting is an essential service that most homeowners will need at some point in their lives. This means becoming a part of this booming industry is a wise decision that’ll challenge you and enrich your life.
So, if you’re considering joining this sector where do you begin? It’s simple, just use the following tips to help you start your window fitting business:
Pick a great name that your customers won’t forget (more on this later) and consider branding for your company. You can also build a basic website to help you book appointments, show the products you sell and give answers to frequently asked questions.
Work out your target market. You could choose to work with retail business, at customer’s homes, or at business offices and picking a specialism can help to define your business.
Consider whether you can afford to start a new business right now. Thankfully start-up costs for a window fitting business aren’t too high (more on this coming up) but you’ll still need an initial investment.
Do you have the right experience and training to get started in this industry? Remember you can always hire workers to actually fit the windows, but you’ll need to pay them a fair salary.
Research your competitors and look for gaps in the market. For example, if there are no other businesses offering aluminium window frames in your area, this is a demand you can fulfil.
Speak to others in the trade for tips on how they got started and ask about common pitfalls you can avoid.
If you feel a little lost and need extra support, consider joining our  members community  where you can ask questions and get advice.
Decide whether you’ll offer free quotes. This may mean more customers choose your business, especially if your competitors don’t offer this service.
In order to bring in more customers, you could also offer repairs or window maintenance for a monthly fee.
How to start a window installation business
It’s true that competition in the window fitting business is high but the reason for this is that demand is also high. So, by no means does this mean there isn’t a gap in the market for you to fill.
The best way to start a window installation business with strong foundations is to put together a full business plan. Use the following sections to cover all the essential factors:
Customers first
Start by considering your target market, who they’ll be and how you’ll reach them. Try to find a gap in the market that you can fill to give your business a unique selling point. This will help you to meet the needs of more customers. You can also reach customers through advertising, social media or building a website.
If finding new customers is a concern, why not  join Checkatrade ? We’ll support you as your business grows with free marketing materials. In addition, you’ll benefit from the thousands of customer leads we receive every month. What better way to boost your new company?
Following the law
Every new business needs to ensure that everything is done above board. You’ll want to ensure you have the right licences and insurance in place before you start taking on customers. It’s also vital that you register with the HMRC and pay the correct amount of tax and National Insurance.
In addition, you should always keep hold of any invoices or receipts for tax purposes.
Running your business
Starting a window fitting business will see you making many different logistical decisions. These choices will give your company a detailed road map to follow.
You’ll need to decide how you’ll source new windows, if you’ll offer additional services, how far you’re willing to travel for jobs and if your van is large enough to transport windows, to name a few choices. Plus, you can always have windows delivered directly to your customers to make life easier for you.
Money talks
One of the most important aspects of starting a business is the financial side. We’ll be covering start-up costs in more detail later, but you need to plan how you’ll fund these. Will you save up the funds yourself, take out a loan, take out a credit card or ask for an investment? You also need to decide how much you’ll charge for your services and ensure you make a good profit.
Once your company is up and running you may decide to offer finance for your customers. This allows them to pay over time which can be a big draw. You can even work with a finance company in a mutually beneficial relationship to support your clients.
Coming up with window installation business names
When it comes to picking a window installation business name it’s ok to have a little fun. Staring a new company can be a lot of work so take this opportunity to play around with your different options. You could choose a window pun or a name that best suits your company values. Remember to make your business name memorable, catchy and unique.
FAQs
How much does it cost to start a window installation business?
Every business will require some kind of start-up costs and these will vary from business to business. So how much does it cost to start a window installation business? Well, you may be surprised to hear it’s actually quite affordable.

Do you need a Licence to fit windows?
It’s important that you have the necessary licences and accreditations if you plan to fit windows for a living. Your clients will want to hire a professional who not only provides a high-quality service but also fits windows according to building regulations. It’s definitely worth getting FENSA registered so you can self-certify that your windows meet building regulations.
Useful checklist for starting a window fitting business
Get a head start on your competition by meeting the needs of your customers, offering a high-quality service and providing services that aren’t already covered in your area.
Most new businesses aren’t prepared for any legal action taken against them so getting insurance will protect you in case of any unsatisfied past customers.
Starting a window fitting business is relatively affordable so you won’t need a large investment up front.
Creating a business plan is the best way to hit the ground running when building your company. Joining Checkatrade  is the ideal way to increase your customer base and receive support when you need it.

How to connect CCTV to your TV wirelessly,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/connect-cctv-to-tv-wirelessly/,"Bedroom, Living Room","How to connect CCTV to your TV wirelessly

In This Blog: How to connect a digital video recorder (DVR) to a TV wirelessly How to connect using NVR (Network Video Recorder) How to connect using NetcamViewer monitor How to connect using streaming apps Advantages of using wireless CCTV Flexible Disadvantages to be aware of for using wireless CCTV FAQS How can I watch CCTV on my smart TV? How can I view my security cameras on my TV? How do wireless security cameras work? Unsure of how to connect your wireless security camera to your TV? First things first, it’s important to note that ‘wirelessly’ means you have wireless security cameras (IP cameras). This guide focuses on wireless cameras rather than wired cameras.
With the increasing popularity of IP cameras (Internet Protocol cameras) in our homes, more and more people want to understand how to install them correctly. While you may enjoy connecting and watching your surveillance cameras remotely using your mobile app, others prefer to watch their camera on a sizable TV screen; like a Sony TV, Samsung TV, or another kind of smart TV.
Connecting the CCTV to your TV wirelessly is by no means a walk in the park, but it isn’t impossible. Rigging up your CCTV system typically involves three straightforward techniques, which we’ll look at below.
If you’re connecting with a wire, you’ll be using an HDMI cable in your TV from the camera hub. However, you can use a smart TV app and use the wireless approach.
If you need help setting up your CCTV camera so it works with your TV, it’s best to get an experienced TV engineer or CCTV installer to help you with a personalised plan to ensure you’re up and running in no time. You can find out about prices in our guide to  professional CCTV installation costs .
When it comes to your and your family’s safety and security, it’s best to get advice or to work with a professional. You can easily 
find CCTV experts recommended by your neighbours
 here on Checkatrade.

Get help from installers recommended by neighbours  How to connect a digital video recorder (DVR) to a TV wirelessly There are several ways to plug your DVR into your television wirelessly, but the best way by far is doing this via the HDMI cable.
Step 1:
 Make sure you switch off your TV and DVR before you start.
Step 2:
 Plug one bit of the cable into the DVR. Attach one end of a standard HDMI cable to the HDMI 1 Out port (this is on the rear of the DVR box).
Step 3:
 Connect the other end of the same HDMI cable into the HDMI 1 In port (you’ll see this either on the side or reverse of your TV).
Step 4:
 To connect the two appliances, switch on the TV and DVR. Turn your TV to the appropriate HDMI input source to use the DVR. To change the input setting, push your remote control or TV’s ‘Input’ or ‘Source’ button. Browse the choices until you see ‘HDMI.’ How to connect using NVR (Network Video Recorder) This is arguably the simplest way to link your wireless CCTV camera to your TV wirelessly. We advise seeking the help of a
 professional CCTV installer
 to perform the job properly, as it’s a rather tech-heavy task.
This method depends on whether you use the HDMI cable to watch your CCTV security cameras on your television. Wirelessly means you have wire-free CCTV cameras installed, but in terms of  installing the security camera  to your television, you’ll use an HDMI cable.
Step 1:
 Link the security cameras to the Network Video recorder (NVR) gadget. Any wireless security system uses a Wi-Fi signal, and any security system has Ethernet Cat 5/6 wires.
Step 2:
 Your CCTV comes with an HDMI cable – connect it straight to the NVR (near the HDMI output port in the NVR) and link it to the HDMI input port on the television.
Step 3:
 Hook the entire security system up to the power and then switch on the cameras and NVR, separately, via its power adaptor.
Step 4:
 Finally, switch on your TV – you’ll now be able to watch your CCTV cameras while you’re switching TV stations. How to connect using NetcamViewer monitor If the technique above sounds too complicated, you may be better off following this second technique for connecting your CCTV camera to your TV wirelessly. This process uses a device known as a NetcamViewer Monitor and works if you have multiple security cameras and want to watch all of them on your TV.
A NetcamViewer Monitor is a minuscule appliance that’s easy to configure, enables you to watch your CCTV camera on your TV screen, and supports over 600 camera brands.
Step 1:
 Plug the IP camera into the NetcamViewer via the Ethernet cable.
Step 2:
 Using the HDMI cable, link the NetcamViewer to the TV.
Step 3:
 This clever device displays numerous cameras in an arrangement on a full-scale screen, displaying up to nine cameras at the same time on the screen.

Get help from installers recommended by neighbours  How to connect using streaming apps Alternatively, you can connect your camera to your TV wirelessly by using your IP camera’s viewing apps. But this is only possible if you own a smart TV from brands such as Samsung or LG.
Step 1:
 To use and connect it, download the relevant viewing app (preferably one your camera manufacturer advises).
Step 2:
 You’ll now be able to view your cameras from your smartphone via the viewing app. Advantages of using wireless CCTV There are loads of benefits of connecting wireless CCTV cameras over their wired counterparts, which we’ve listed below.
No wires – as the name suggest
The main benefit of wireless CCTV cameras is the fact they’re cable-free.
With wired CCTV systems, on the other hand, intruders can simply cut the wire using scissors. Burglars can blind the latest wired CCTV cameras by disrupting telephone lines and power cables while wireless cameras have absolutely no wires for intruders to attack.
Investing in a burglar alarm is a smart solution that goes a long way in safeguarding your home from unwelcome trespassers – check out our  burglar alarm cost guide  to find out more about prices.
Easy to install
Installing wireless CCTV is extremely simple, involves hardly any time, and enables you to position the cameras in any direction you like.
Wired CCTV cameras, though, require you to drill holes in the wall and get a mounting kit. While it’s not an overly taxing task, rigging up something to hold the camera can be laborious. Flexible With wireless CCTV, you have more flexibility, as the absence of wires lets you position them in any location you like. What’s more, you won’t have to lose sleep about hooking them up to an outlet. Not only this, you can set wireless cameras up to a whole host of locations and tangibly move them to different settings – with no wires in sight. Disadvantages to be aware of for using wireless CCTV Interference
The main drawback with wireless CCTV cameras is that they’re prone to interference, making them less trustworthy in certain situations. Because we live in an incredibly connected world, full of wireless signals and broadcasts, these competing transmissions can pose issues. Your router’s signal strength and other routers on the same bandwidth overlap and cause interference for devices.
Easy to steal
Perhaps the real sticking point of a wireless CCTV system is (depending on the camera type and how it’s fitted) how easy it could be for intruders to steal it.
Power can run out
Because wireless cameras don’t connect to a continuous external power source, they’re susceptible to running out of power and need changing. Numerous battery-operated CCTV cameras aren’t designed for constant recording, so the batteries will run out. FAQS How can I watch CCTV on my smart TV? One of the best methods to watch CCTV on your smart TV is to stream it (see ‘How to connect using streaming apps’ method above). If you’ve linked your wire-free camera via the internet, several models feature in-built systems that integrate RTSP (real-time streaming protocol), enabling connection to the camera’s app.
Simply:
Open the app on your television
Use Google’s Chromecast How can I view my security cameras on my TV? You can view your security cameras on your TV by following these straightforward steps:
Set up your security cameras to the NVR using Ethernet Cat 5/6 cables.
Connect the CCTV camera NVR to your smart TV by using your HDMI cable.
Switch on your NVR using the power adapter.
Switch your television on, and you’ll see the live view on the screen. How do wireless security cameras work? Wireless CCTV cameras work by transferring surveillance footage to a cloud-based server across the internet. Doing so allows you to watch the footage on your television or any other internet-connected gadget, but you’ll still need wired power.

How to cut plastic lattice fencing,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/cut-plastic-lattice-fencing/,Garden,"How to cut plastic lattice fencing

In This Blog: How to cut plastic lattice fencing How to cut lattice without a saw FAQs If you’re researching how to cut plastic lattice fencing, you’re either installing or repairing a fence and need some guidance on how to do this easily and safely.
Thankfully, this guide is going to take you through the process step by step. So, read on for our top tips and expert guidance.
Don’t forget to check out our  how to build a fence  guide for more handy DIY advice. How to cut plastic lattice fencing Tools you’ll need for the job
To make short work of your plastic lattice fencing, you’ll need the following:
Safety equipment
Pencil
Ruler
Fence clamps
Circular saw
Step 1: Measure the area
If you’re installing a new lattice fence, it’s worth cutting it to size beforehand. To do this, measure the area of your project and write down the W, H and L measurements. You can then either buy the same size lattice panels or you can cut your existing plastic lattice panels to size.
Top tip:
 Leave around 0.25 inches on either side of the lattice to allow for adverse weather conditions that can contract and expand the plastic.
Step 2: Make allowances for frames
If you’re using frames, make sure the lattice measurements take into account the framing materials, caps, and dividers. Use the following calculation as an example:
Project space:
 6ft wide (72 inches) + 
Buffer
: 0.25 inches = 
72.25 inches
Subtract the frame thickness:
 6 inches.
Width of lattice to be cut: 
 72.25 – 6 = 
66.25 inches
.
Step 3: Make allowances for the height of the lattice fence
For plastic lattice fences that are being used as garden borders, add around 2 inches to the height. This allows them to be secured in the soil, keeping them firmly in place.
Step 4: Mark where you need to cut the lattice
Now your measurements are set, it’s time to put on your protective equipment and get to work. Take your pencil and ruler and draw a straight line where the lattice needs to be cut.
Top tip:
 Remove the staples and nails that the pencil touches. This reduces the risk of spring back and makes cutting the lattice easier.
Step 5: Line up the lattice
Once your lattice is prepared, place it on a sturdy, flat surface. Line up the lattice so the pencil line is about 3 inches away from the edge of your flat surface and secure with the clamps. This will stop your lattice from moving while you make the cuts.
Step 6: Cut the lattice to size
Take your circular saw and set the blade half an inch wider than your lattice’s thickness. A vinyl cutting blade will be best for this job. However, a reciprocating saw will also work. (Just don’t use anything designed for wood).
Once you’re ready to make the cuts, squeeze the saw’s trigger and slowly follow the pencil line.
Hurrah! You’ve now cut your plastic lattice fencing.
Note:
 If you don’t know how to competently use a circular saw, we highly recommend  hiring a professional .

Find fencers your neighbours recommend  How to cut lattice without a saw If you don’t have a cutting saw, then we recommend using a handheld wire cutting tool. It will take you longer; however, it’s a more precise finish and far less dangerous! FAQs What is the best tool to use to cut plastic lattice?
A circular saw with vinyl-cutting blades is your best bet. Otherwise, a good pair of fence cutters will do the job.
How do you cut plastic lattice?
You either  hire one of our experts  for a professional finish or you attempt to do it yourself following our step-by-step guide above.
Should I hire a professional?
We always recommend hiring a professional for jobs that involve tools like saws. However, it’s also worth investing in a fencing expert to make sure the finished result is long-lasting and durable.

How to fix a sagging sofa,https://www.checkatrade.com/blog/how-to/fix-sagging-sofa/,Living Room,"How to fix a sagging sofa

In This Blog: How to fix a sagging sofa How to fix sagging sofa cushions yourself How to fix sagging sofa springs How to fix a sagging sofa with plywood FAQs There are several reasons you might need to learn how to fix a sagging sofa. Sadly, our beloved couches don’t last forever. However, if you’re not quite ready to give up your trusty stead, you might be tempted to fix it instead.
You can do this by hiring an expert to complete a professional repair or by attempting various DIY methods yourself.
This blog is going to focus on the latter. So, read on for our step by step guide.

Find repairers your neighbours recommend  How to fix a sagging sofa Before you begin, you need to work out the cause of the sagging. Is it a broken frame? Are the springs old and worn? Or do the cushions need restoring?
Once you’ve identified the cause, it’s time to get to work. How to fix sagging sofa cushions yourself If your sofa is sagging because of worn-out cushions, then it’s a good time to wash the cushion covers and revamp the inside layer with new stuffing. Most cushions are filled with foam and ‘batting,’ which is an upholstery fabric made out of wool, cotton or polyester blends. The batting covers the foam to create a smooth finish. So, if the batting is worn, you can just replace it and leave the foam. But if the foam is dented, it’s worth replacing the entire cushion.
To do this, either  hire a professional  to restore your cushions for an expert finish or take the entire cushion to your local upholstery shop so they can replace it for you. Alternatively, measure the height, width and depth of your foam and batting and order replacement materials online.
Top tip:
 If you’re doing it yourself, be sure to cut the batting to shape. We recommend layering it around the foam and smoothing it out to avoid lumps.

Find repairers your neighbours recommend  How to fix sagging sofa springs Repairing sagging sofa springs is one of the trickier aspects of sofa repairs. So, unless you’re a confident DIY’er, we highly recommend hiring a professional to come and do the job for you. Read our  sofa spring repair cost guide  for information about pricing up your project.
However, if you’d like to do it yourself, read our step by step guide below.
Step one:
 Inspect the springs on your sofa by removing the dust cover. Does your couch use zigzag or coiled springs? And are they bent or broken?
We ask because bent springs are easier to fix yourself while broken springs require a professional replacement due to the need for specialised tools.
Step two:
 For springs that are bent, use a pair of pliers to bend them back into shape. This works for zigzag springs but will have a limited effect on coiled makes, which will need to be replaced.
Step three:
 If you still want to do it yourself, remove any broken springs and recycle them. Then, use a spring compressor tool on either end of the replacement spring, turning the handles clockwise with a wrench to pry the coils open. This will allow you to thread each end of the spring through the supports screwed into opposite ends of your sofa.
Step four:
 Turn the compression tool anticlockwise to decompress the springs and secure them in place.
Step five:
 Replace any fabric or dust cover that needed removing to get to the springs.
Note:
 This is a dangerous job that needs to be done using proper care and consideration. Trapped fingers and spring-back accidents are common occurrences. How to fix a sagging sofa with plywood For broken frames, you can use plywood to fix the issue. There are two issues plywood can resolve when it comes to a sagging sofa. These are broken slats or broken frames. We’re going to explain how to fix both.
Tools you need for the job
Before you get started, add the following to your arsenal:
Replacement wood
Screwdriver
Nail remover
Wood filler
Staple gun
Step one:
 Check the slats and frame and remove any broken wood. Do this carefully to avoid tearing your sofa fabric. Pry out any nails or broken springs attached to the wood.
Step two:
 Work out what replacement wood is needed and purchase the right dimensions, plus a little extra in case you make a mistake.
Step three:
 Remove the broken boards with the new boards using your staple gun to secure them in place. For extra security, add wood glue to the joints and let everything dry overnight.
Step four:
 Once your wood glue is set, reupholster your sofa by replacing any fabric or springs.

Find repairers your neighbours recommend  FAQs How can I make my sofa firmer?
To make your sofa firmer, replace your cushion filling with higher-density foam and batting. You can also secure a piece of plywood between the couch frame and the cushions, which adds extra support. 
Note:
 This won’t work for couches with cushions that are permanently attached.
Can you fix a sunken couch?
It’s possible to follow our step by step guide above to fix a sunken couch. However, for a long-lasting and professional finish, we always recommend  hiring one of our experts .
How do you fix a sagging couch with plywood?
Follow our ‘how to fix a sagging sofa with plywood’ guide above. Alternatively,  hire an expert your neighbours recommend  to undertake a professional repair.
